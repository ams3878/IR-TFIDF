<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [humming and hmm-ing] No... Aha! Here it is.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What is <i>that</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Come on, Starlight, don't judge a book
 by its cover. This is the friendship journal my friends and I used to
keep. It's filled with all the things we've learned, like: "Friendship
isn't always easy, but there's no doubt, it's worth fighting for."

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Wait a minute. [gasps] Is this our old friendship journal? I haven't seen this thing in forever!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hoo-wee! It's lookin' a little, uh... overripe.

</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: There's a smushed apple in Applejack's lessons.

</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Looks like you got a little aggressive with your friendship lessons, Rainbow Dash.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What can I say? When I learn something, I learn it hard.

</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [unimpressed] I found Pinkie's page.

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ta-da! Starlight and I decided to make one for each of you!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: That's amazin'! A perfect copy!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I learned the spell years ago when I needed to make copies of a certain— [long pause] [clears throat] ...manifesto.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [sniffs] Ahhh! Even better than a perfect copy.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, I'd forgotten all about this lesson.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [laughing] Remember this one from when I
helped Daring Do? "Never underestimate the power of friends who always
got your back."
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Aww, Cheese Sandwich! Party cannon! Ah! <i>Birth-iversary!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: After Twilight remembered the
journal, I had so much fun reading all the stuff you've all learned, I
just had to have my own copy.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And that brings me to the second part
of the surprise. My idea. How would you girls feel about making our
journal available for everypony? If we can get these lessons into other
ponies' hooves, maybe they'll benefit from them.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Well, I think that's a great idea.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I'm in! Yay!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: W-We always said we wanted to.

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hey, girls. Couldn't help but
overhear. You might want to take a breather, maybe read Rainbow Dash's
chapter on Rainbow Falls? It might help.
</dd><dd><b>Toola Roola</b>: Sure, Princess.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Thanks, Twilight! The friendship journal's makin' us super popular!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: We were thinkin' of puttin' together a
cutie mark summer camp. Now, everypony's definitely gonna sign up for
it! This is gonna be awesome! [laughs] Cutie Mark Crusaders, whoo.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: A cutie mark camp <i>is</i> a great idea.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah, but the purpose of the journal isn't supposed to be <i>marketing</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I just hope those foals actually learn something from our lessons.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: They will! I'm sure ponies all across Equestria will— Whoa!

</dd><dd><b>Out of Town Pony</b>: We're here all the way from Fillydelphia because we got copies of your friendship journal!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Wow! How wonderful! What was your favorite friendship—
</dd><dd><b>Out of Town Pony</b>: Will you sign them?!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, uh, I guess so. So, what did you think of the lessons?
</dd><dd><b>Out of Town Pony</b>: Oh, we haven't read them. These are keepsakes. We gotta keep them in mint condition. Ha-ha.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh.

</dd><dd><b>Diamond Cutter</b>: Well, I for one found the journal <i>terribly</i> illuminating.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Daisy</b>: I agree. I'm seeing sides of these ponies I didn't know were there. I only wish they'd left Rarity out. <i>She</i> clearly doesn't belong in that book with the rest of them.
</dd><dd><b>Diamond Cutter</b>: Oh, I know! Who does she think she is?
Certainly she did a fine job setting up the Ponyville Days celebration,
but does she really believe it was a success just because of her?
[inconsiderate laughter] The nerve!

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Giggly feedback is the best kind!
</dd><dd>[ponies laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, at least you're getting a
positive reaction. I just saw Rarity, and I'm afraid this whole journal
thing really upset her.

</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hey, <i>here's</i> a great idea! Why don't you guys talk to <i>Twilight</i> for a while? So I can get back to things like working and napping and, well, pretty much anything else.
</dd><dd><b>"Princess Erroria"</b>: Aw, we don't wanna hear her bowing lessons! Come on! Tell us again about when you met Dawing Do!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [laughs nervously] Again? Haven't we already covered that one? A couple dozen times?

</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What? Really?! Are you attacking my friend because you want to be in a book?!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: It's okay. I got this, girls. [inhales] Listen up! I <i>am</i> more assertive! And yes, it took me a while to get there. But can you honestly say that <i>you</i> could learn something one time and completely change who you are? [beat] I didn't think so.
</dd><dd><b>Glasses Stallion</b>: Wow. You're way different from the Fluttershy in the book. I don't know how I feel about that.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [sighs]

Was it that bad at Sweet Apple Acres?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's bad everywhere. I thought I was
doing something good. I thought I was helping. How could our friendship
journal have led to so much... anti-friendship?!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Oh, Twilight, it's not your fault.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Of course it's my fault! If I hadn't had the <i>big idea</i> to make copies, none of this would be happening! I'm afraid I made life awful for my friends!

</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: It's not your fault. It's everypony

here! I've got an idea!

</dd><dd><b>Reporter Pony</b>: Princess Twilight, I'm with the <i>Canterlot Chronicle</i>. Quick question — what would you say to ponies who wonder why you moved to Ponyville in the first place?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I moved here to learn about
friendship. That's why the journal even exists. It took some time for me
 to get the hang of it, but it was each of these ponies standing next to
 me who taught me the lessons in those journals. Applejack, Pinkie Pie,
Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Fluttershy, too. Then it was all of you. I've
learned so much from—
</dd><dd><b>Reporter Pony</b>: What I mean is, some ponies would argue that it doesn't seem believable that the six of you would be friends.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: "Believable"?
</dd><dd><b>Reporter Pony</b>: Well, sure. I read this journal cover to
cover, and I have to say your character would have been much more
interesting if she'd stayed in Canterlot.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: My <i>character</i>?! We are <i>real</i> ponies! This journal is a record of things that actually happened to us! We made mistakes, and we learned from them!
</dd><dd><b>Diamond Cutter</b>: What about Rarity? Are we really supposed to believe everything she wrote in there?
</dd><dd><b>"Princess Erroria"</b>: That's why you wanna be Team Dash!
She's the only one that didn't weally need to learn anything, because
she was alweady so cool.
</dd><dd><b>Pearly Stitch</b>: Twilight was better before she got wings!
</dd><dd><b>"Lemon Chiffon"</b>: Fluttershy is just so painfully shy, it's hard to relate! I mean, come on!
