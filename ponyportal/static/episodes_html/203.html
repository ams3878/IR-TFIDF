<dl><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: [clears throat] I don't want to tattle on my good friend Tirek, but... you might like to know he left food out. Again.
</dd><dd><b>Grogar</b>: I'll deal with it when I'm done.
</dd><dd><b>Lord Tirek</b>: Don't trust anything that nosy little Pegasus says!
</dd><dd><b>Grogar</b>: I don't trust anything <i>any</i> of you say.
</dd><dd><b>Lord Tirek</b>: Hmph!
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Are you planning on attacking anypony anytime soon? If not, I don't know why I'm wasting my time here. I <i>am</i> a queen, you know?
</dd><dd><b>Grogar</b>: [snorts] I'm leaving, since it's impossible to
accomplish the work I need to do here. I suggest the three of you come
to some kind of accord.

together! Only then can we accomplish what you so greatly desire – the
defeat of Twilight Sparkle and her friends!

<dl><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: Nothing says "teamwork" like an inspirational
banner. When Grogar sees this, he'll realize there's no way he could
survive without <i>me</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Lord Tirek</b>: [grunting]
</dd><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: You're gonna have to exercise a lot to get as
 big as you were when you absorbed the life force of all those ponies.
Anywho, Grogar wants us all to work together, so I've scheduled a team
meeting. Doesn't that sound fun? And since Grogar left <i>me</i> in charge...
</dd><dd><b>Lord Tirek</b>: No, he didn't.
</dd><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: [giggles] Someone's a real grumpy-taur today.
 If we aren't meeting, I guess I could just stay and offer positive and
inspiring—
</dd><dd><b>Lord Tirek</b>: Fine! I'll join your meeting. Just leave!
</dd><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: See you soon!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: It's been weeks, and Grogar's done nothing! It's not healthy to hold on to all of this <i>rage</i>! I could lash out at any moment.
</dd><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: And how are you doing this fine—?
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: How do you <i>think</i> I'm doing?! I'm ready to exact my revenge! [to hunk of wood] See what I mean?
</dd><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: Being cooped up with nothing to do is the worst! You know what you need? A team meeting!
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: I don't do meetings.
</dd><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: Grogar left me in charge.
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: No, he didn't. And even if he did, Chrysalis obeys no one.
</dd><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: [singsongy] There'll be cupcakes.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: Grogar wants us to work together to defeat our enemies. Which means we need to trust each other.
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: [chewing] If we are to trust one another, perhaps inform Lord Tirek to <i>stop trying to absorb my essence!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Lord Tirek</b>: [spits] I wasn't doing anything of the sort! How dare you!
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: How dare I?! Do you know to whom you are speaking?
</dd><dd><b>Lord Tirek</b>: How could I not? You tell your log every five minutes.
</dd><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: This is why Grogar left <i>me</i> in charge.

</dd><dd><b>Lord Tirek</b>: Assuming you even <i>have</i> a plan.
</dd><dd><b>Grogar</b>: Of course I have a plan! I have located an
object of power, and it occurs to me this is the perfect test. The three

ponies won't stand a chance.
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: I have come close to ruling Equestria several times. Perhaps <i>I</i> should be the one to lead us.

</dd><dd><b>Grogar</b>: Now <i>you</i> shall retrieve the rest of it.

<dl><dd><b>Grogar</b>: [narrating] Thousands of moons ago, the
self-righteous Gusty the Great, unable to best me face-to-face, stole my
 Bewitching Bell. A talisman containing much of my own magic. The Bell
cannot be destroyed, so Gusty hid it in a place it has taken me
millennia to discover – an enchanted cave high atop Mt. Everhoof,
protected by magical winds that prevent anypony from reaching its peak.
There, the Bell has remained until now.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Grogar</b>: Scale Mt. Everhoof. Bring me back my Bell.
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: [laughs] The ease of this task is laughable.

<dl><dd>[bird screeches]
</dd><dd><b>Lord Tirek</b>: Scale the mountain...
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: ...retrieve Grogar's Bell...
</dd><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: ...together! I drew up a detailed plan with
several visual aids to show how we can... ditch each other and do it
alone. Maybe when I'm waiting for them at the top, <i>then</i> they'll appreciate me.

 to keep ponies from heading up. Nothing at the top but dangerous snow,

subject myself to the elements, I decided to let you two face the

</dd><dd><b>Lord Tirek</b>: Those ponies have weaknesses. I used that turncoat Discord. Tricked him into helping me capture his so-called "friends".
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: [sighs] Discord was really something until friendship ruined him.
