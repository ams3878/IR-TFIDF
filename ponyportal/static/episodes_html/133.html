</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I hope Shining Armor and Princess
Cadance don't think it's too soon for me to come back to the Crystal
Empire for a visit. But I just know Flurry Heart's grown so much
already. I wonder if I'll even recognize her.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: She's the only baby they have, Twilight. I think it'll be pretty easy to figure out who she is.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [annoyed grunt]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Sorry. I know you want to visit your
niece as much as possible, and I'm excited to see Sunburst again. I just
 don't wanna fall behind on my friendship lessons back home.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Starlight, your work in Ponyville
isn't going anywhere. Besides, I think we all know you can learn about
friendship anywhere. Right, Spike?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [deep voice] "Spike?" Who's "Spike"?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Pfft. Uh, <i>you're</i> Spike, Spike. And why are you dressed like that?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [groans] [normal voice] Guys, you're blowing my cover! How'd you even know it was me?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Because you're <i>you</i>... in a coat, hat and glasses. Also, we're the only ones here.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Right.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike, why do you need a disguise?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Last time we came to the Crystal Empire, there was a lot goin' on with the new baby and the Crystalling, but I <i>still</i> got mobbed in the street.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I wouldn't say mobbed.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: And this is just a family visit. I wouldn't want
the presence of Spike the Brave and Glorious to turn it into some kind
of circus.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: We get it. The Crystal Ponies adore you.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: He <i>did</i> save the Empire. Twice. But still, I don't think your presence will turn our visit into a circus.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Not if I find the right disguise, it won't.

<dl><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Uh, disguise or not, Spike, I don't think you need to worry about being mobbed. Nopony's here.

</dd><dd>[tumbleweed drifting]
</dd><dd>[bird cries]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: It's like a ghost town.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I've got a bad feeling about this.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Yeah, this is weird.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I guess I don't need the disguise after all.
</dd><dd>[Crystal Ponies cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Honeysparkle</b>: It's Spike the Brave and Glorious!
</dd><dd><b>Sapphire Joy</b>: He's come to save us yet again!
</dd><dd><b>Crystal Ponies</b>: Spike! Spike! Spike! Spike!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Save you from what?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Yeah, what's going on?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Why was everypony hiding?
</dd><dd><b>"Amber Laurel"</b>: Oh, it sure <i>looks</i> like Princess Twilight and her pupil.
</dd><dd><b>"Scarlet Heart"</b>: But how can we be sure?
</dd><dd><b>"Golden Väs"</b>: We can't! Either one of them could be the... you know!
</dd><dd>[zip!]
</dd><dd><b>"Amber Laurel"</b>: [gasps] What if this... [gasps] isn't... [gasps] the real Spike?!
</dd><dd><b>"Scarlet Heart"</b>: Everypony, run!
</dd><dd>[zip!]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Okay. Something strange is definitely going on.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [groans] Ya think?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Royal guard 1</b>: Who goes there?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Um, you don't recognize the Princess of Friendship?
</dd><dd><b>Royal guard 1</b>: Of course we recognize her.
</dd><dd><b>Royal guard 2</b>: But that doesn't mean it's really her.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: It's okay, guys. They're with me. And any friend
of Spike the Brave and Glorious is a friend of the Crystal Empire, am I
right?
</dd><dd><b>Royal guard 2</b>: Huh. It does look like him.
</dd><dd><b>Royal guard 1</b>: Well, it would, wouldn't it? I'm sorry, but we'll need to see some proof of identification.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: We'll take care of things from here.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, Cadance, thank goodness! What's going on?
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: We can explain, Twily... if it really <i>is</i> you.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: Sunshine, sunshine...
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b> and <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: ...ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake! Mmm!
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: It's okay, everypony. It's her.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Of course it's her! What's all this about?
</dd><dd><b>Sunburst</b>: A changeling's been spotted nearby.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: A changeling?!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: That's not good.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: No, it's not. After Queen Chrysalis
took my place at our wedding and invaded Canterlot with her army of
minions, we're not taking any chances.
</dd><dd><b>Sunburst</b>: Changelings feed off of love. And ever since
Flurry Heart's Crystalling, the Empire is filled with more love than
anywhere in Equestria. It's possible they've come for the baby.
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: That's why we posted the extra guards, and why we're—
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Checking everypony's identity.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: I'm sorry for all of this. Flurry Heart's really been looking forward to seeing you.
</dd><dd><b>Flurry Heart</b>: [coos]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, she's gotten so big! Starlight and I will do whatever we can to help protect her.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: To be honest, having you here is already a big relief.
</dd><dd><b>Royal guard 2</b>: [whispers indistinctly]
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: Hmm. The royal guards were wondering if Spike the Brave and Glorious would like to join in the search for the changeling.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Really?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Uh, I don't know if that's such a good idea, Spike. It sounds dangerous.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Come on, Twilight, this is Spike the Brave and Glorious you're talking to. Have you ever known me to run from danger?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Um...
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: He'll be safe with our guards.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Or will your guards be safe with <i>me</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sighs]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Royal guard 1</b>: Spike the Brave and Glorious, you've faced the evil changelings before. What can you tell us?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh, uh, well, they are changelings, so they can... change.
</dd><dd><b>Royal guard 1</b>: [to other guards] You hear that? These monsters can look like any of us, so be on guard, guards! Even more than normal.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: And they could be anywhere.
</dd><dd><b>Royal guards</b>: [affirming snort]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: So we should cover as much ground as possible. You, search that way!
</dd><dd>[whoosh]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: And you, search that way!
</dd><dd>[whoosh]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: And... I'll... just search... here, I guess. Not many places to hide. Unless that rock <i>is</i>
 a changeling. Okay, rock. How do I know you're really a rock? Hmm. Not
talkin', huh? Well, you can't fool me! Uhh! Ow! [screams]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Oh! Uhh!
</dd><dd>[boulder thuds]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Phew! [kisses] Okay. Maybe it's time Spike the
Brave and Glorious went back to, uh, protect those guards. Gah! [sighs]
Just my reflection. Huh? Ha! Ha-ha! Hmm. Just my imagination, I guess.
</dd><dd>[transformation noise]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [screams]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-changeling! [stutters]
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: No, wait! Come back!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [screaming]
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [screaming] This is unexpected.
</dd><dd>[splat]
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: The ice is pretty slippery. I wouldn't want you to get hurt because of me.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: You... saved me?
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: It's okay. I know you don't wanna be friends.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Wait! I don't understand. Changelings are supposed to be evil... right?
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Evil? Oh, not me. All I've ever wanted is a friend.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Thorax</b>: [narrating] From the moment I first split my egg in the nursery hive...
</dd><dd>[changeling larva hissing]
</dd><dd><b>Baby Thorax</b>: [whimpering]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Thorax</b>: [narrating] I was part of the attack on Canterlot
 during the royal wedding, but I'd never seen true friendship like that!
 And I couldn't just steal it and feed on its love. I wanted to share
it!
</dd><dd>[explosion]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Thorax</b>: After that, I knew I couldn't live with my kind anymore. I set off looking for love to share, but...
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: But... what?
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: I'm starving! And there's so much love in the Crystal Empire right now. It's what drew me here! But it's drivin' me crazy!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: That would be from the royal Crystalling. It's pretty much a giant outpouring of light and love for a new baby.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: [hisses] Oh, sorry! I'm just so hungry! If I had
 a friend, maybe the love we shared could sustain me, but I don't think
the Crystal Ponies want to be friends.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: What if I told you there was somepony they respect and admire so much, he could convince them to give it a try?
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: If only that were true.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: It is! I mean, <i>I</i> am! It's me, Spike! Spike the Brave and Glorious? I'm sure you've heard of me.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Nope. But I was raised by an evil queen. I'm Thorax. I can't believe you want to help me.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Why? Hasn't anypony ever just been nice to you?
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: [hisses] Uh! S-Sorry! Kindness like that kind of brings it out. Do you still wanna be my friend?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Of course! And I am one hundred percent sure I can get the whole Crystal Empire to be your friend too.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: [hisses]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: But... maybe I should just, uh, talk to them first.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: [muffled grunting]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Royal guard 1</b>: What do you mean? Did you see the changeling?
</dd><dd><b>Royal guard 2</b>: Did you defeat the evil creature?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Defeating a changeling would be brave, but do you know what would be glorious?
</dd><dd><b>Royal guard 1</b>: Defeating <i>two</i> changelings?
</dd><dd><b>Royal guard 2</b>: Defeating <i>all</i> the changelings?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Not having to fight the changeling at all! Because I made friends with him.
</dd><dd>[guards laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Royal guard 1</b>: Oh, wow! For a second I thought you were serious!
</dd><dd><b>Royal guard 2</b>: [laughing] Could you imagine? Friends with a changeling?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I <i>am</i> serious. He wants to be friends!
</dd><dd>[guards laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Royal guard 2</b>: Right!
</dd><dd><b>Royal guard 1</b>: Not only are you Spike the Brave and Glorious, you're also Spike the Hilarious!
</dd><dd><b>Royal guard 2</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I'm not joking! The changeling is nice!
</dd><dd>[guards laughing harder]
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: I'm sorry, but I don't think it's funny. The Changeling Queen Chrysalis kidnapped Cadance and cast a spell on me.
</dd><dd>[zip!]
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: There's no such thing as a <i>nice</i> changeling.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: You're right, Shining Armor. Sorry. That was a... bad joke.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Thorax</b>: So? So? Uh, what did they say? How many new friends do I have?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Well, it didn't go exactly the way I thought.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: [groans] I understand. Well, thanks for trying.
I-I guess it's not surprising. How can you expect ponies who looks like
this... [transformation noise] to trust something that looks like this?
[transformation noise]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I think I might know!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike, if you're done searching for
the changeling, Starlight and I could use your help. We're working on a
protection spell for Flurry Heart, and nopony takes notes like you.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Uh, actually, Twilight, I, uh, wanted to
introduce you to my friend, uh... Uh, Crystal, uh... Hoof! Crystal Hoof!
 [chuckles] My good friend, Crystal Hoof.
</dd><dd><span title="as Crystal Hoof" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Thorax</b></span>: Nice to meet you.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh. Well, it's, uh, nice to meet you, too. How do you know Spike?
</dd><dd><span title="as Crystal Hoof" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Thorax</b></span>: Oh, uh, Spike and I go <i>way</i> back.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: To the Equestria Games! That's when we met. We've been pen pals ever since.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pen pals? Spike! You could have been using my pen pal quill set! Why didn't you tell me?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Well, I... I pretty much only write to him when you and Starlight are... studying.
</dd><dd><span title="as Crystal Hoof" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Thorax</b></span>: I like to brag to all my friends about my letters from Spike the Brave and Glorious.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Yeah. [laughs nervously]
</dd><dd><span title="as Crystal Hoof" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Thorax</b></span> and <b>Spike</b>: [laugh nervously]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, I'm sure Starlight and I can manage, if you want to spend time with your friend.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Great! Crystal Hoof promised to take me around the city.
</dd><dd><span title="as Crystal Hoof" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Thorax</b></span>: Oh, that was amazing!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I told ya.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[montage music]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Royal guard 1</b>: [hushed] Crystal Hoof is nearly as entertaining as Spike himself.
</dd><dd><span title="as Crystal Hoof" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Thorax</b></span>:
 [gasps] This place is everything I've ever dreamed of! [hushed] But I
can't keep pretending to be a Crystal Pony forever, can I?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Relax. You're winning them over. Pretty soon, nopony will care that you're a changeling.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: Spike! Twilight told me you were off with a friend.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [nervous laugh]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: And any friend of Spike the Brave and Glorious is a friend of mine.
</dd><dd><b>Flurry Heart</b>: [coos]
</dd><dd><span title="as Crystal Hoof" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Thorax</b></span>: Oh, she's so beautiful! There's so much l-love around her...! I... I...!
</dd><dd>[transformation noise]

</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b> and <b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: I... [hisses] I'm so... [hisses] ...sorry...! I can't... Can't [hisses] ...stop!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike! Get away from the changeling!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Wait, no! You don't understand!
</dd><dd><b>Sunburst</b>: This changeling replaced your friend to get close to the baby! What other explanation could there be?!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I...
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: [hisses]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: ...I don't know.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: [whimpers]
</dd><dd><b>Royal guard 1</b>: After it! Don't let the changeling escape!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: I hope your friend is okay.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Yeah... Me, too.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Royal guard 1</b>: Spike, you should go find Crystal Hoof while we hunt down the changeling.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I'm pretty sure he doesn't wanna see me.
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: Spread out! The changeling is probably still nearby!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Actually, I'm pretty sure he ran as far away from here as possible.... But I bet I know where!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: Thorax! Hello? I just want to apologize! I should have stood up for you... Aw, come on, Thorax! I know you're in here!
</dd><dd>[transformation noise]
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Leave me alone! [hisses]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [yelps] [panting] Little help?
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Why do you think I would help <i>you</i>? I'm an "evil changeling"!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Because you're my friend. I just wish I had been one to you. [yelps]
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: It's okay, I know it's hard. Everyone in the Crystal Empire loves <i>you</i>. I couldn't ask you to give that up for me.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: You don't have to ask.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: What are you gonna do?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: What I should've done in the first place.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Royal guards</b>: Let's move! Move! Move! This way! This way! Let's go! Check there? Okay. Over here! Over here! [etc.]
</dd><dd>[guards shouting]
</dd><dd><b>Royal guard</b>: Look around that corner! Over there! Over there! [etc.]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I know it's bad that there's a changeling around, but is all this <i>really</i> necessary?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: If there's one changeling, there may well be a whole army on the way.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: True. But Starlight has a point. This is getting a little out of hand.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: [sighs] I understand, but I don't know what else we can do.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I do!
</dd><dd>[ponies gasp]
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: Spike! What are you doing?! Get away from that thing!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: No. He's not a "thing"! His name is Thorax, and he's my friend!
</dd><dd><b>Royal guards</b> and <b>Shining Armor</b>: [gasp]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b> and <b>Sunburst</b>: [gasp]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [gasp]

<dl><dd><b>[Spike]</b>
<dl><dd>Would you say I'm a hero

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike, I'm so proud of you.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: You are?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Of course! You're a celebrity here in
the Crystal Empire, and you just risked all of it for a friend! I can't
imagine anything more brave than that. [to others] As the Princess of
Friendship, I try to set an example for all of Equestria. But today, it
was Spike who taught me that a new friend can come from anywhere. I
guess everypony still has things to learn about friendship. Even me! And
 if Spike says Thorax is his friend, then he's my friend too.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Thank you.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: On behalf of the Crystal Empire, I
would like to extend my hoof in friendship, and I'm sure all of my
subjects are eager to do the same.

</dd><dd><b>Flurry Heart</b>: [coos]
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: Welcome to the Crystal Empire, Thorax. I'm sorry we didn't take the time to get to know you. Maybe we can change that now.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: That'd be so amazing! I want to know all about
friendship, and maybe one day I can take that knowledge back to the
Changeling Kingdom! If my kind learned how to create love for one
another, maybe they wouldn't have to take it from others!
</dd><dd><b>Royal guard 1</b>: To Spike the Brave and Glorious!
