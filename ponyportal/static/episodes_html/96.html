<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Look at that, Tank! Cloudsdale's here! That means Ponyville is next up for winter!
</dd><dd>[ponies running]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You're doing <i>awesome</i>, everypony! Keep it up! We need <i>those</i> leaves off <i>those</i> trees! Once we get autumn cleared away, it'll be <i>hello</i>, winter!
</dd><dd><b>Tank</b>: [yawns]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Was that a <i>yawn</i> I just saw?
</dd><dd><b>Tank</b>: [yawns]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: How can you be tired when the most
exciting time of the year is right around the corner? And don't forget
the best part – our first winter together! Come on, wake up! Once those
ponies bring in the big, fat clouds full of snowflakes, we'll have a ton
 of snow for our extreme sledding! [cheering] And over there, we can
play horse hockey, with no shoulder or arm pads!
</dd><dd>[imaginary crowd cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Everything's looking great, don't you think?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Almost everything. Does Tank look alright to you?
</dd><dd><b>Tank</b>: [yawns]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, he <i>does</i> seem to be moving a little slowly.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I know, right?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And he looks kind of sleepy...
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Totally!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: ...just like he always does.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, ha ha, I'm sure you're right.

<dl><dd>[heart slowly thumping]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well?!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I suppose his heartbeat <i>could</i> be a teensy-weensy-<i>eensy</i> bit slower than usual...
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Okay, so give him a vitamin or something!
</dd><dd><b>Tank</b>: [snoring] [yawns]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I don't think he needs that.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Maybe we're just staying up too late. Uh, too many Daring Do stories.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, that's not it either.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, what's wrong with him then?!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Nothing! He's perfectly fine.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [relieved sigh]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: He's just going to hibernate.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You do realize he's not a bear, right?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [giggles] When the weather grows cold and
less food is available, many animals hibernate to conserve energy. It's
like taking a really long nap during winter, and then they wake up in
spring. And see? Even tortoises do it! When the time comes, Tank will
leave and dig into the ground.
</dd><dd><b>Tank</b>: [yawns]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: But don't worry. He'll reappear when the spring sun warms the ground back up.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Come on! Tortoises don't hibernate! Somepony put that picture in there as a joke.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: It's not a joke.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, then your book must be wrong!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Rainbow Dash, Tank <i>needs</i> to hibernate. It's healthy for him, just like sleeping is healthy for us.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [short laugh] Whatever. Okay, thanks. Come on, Tank.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Where are you going?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: To get a second opinion from a <i>real</i> reptile expert.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: I told you, Rainbow Dash, I'm a dragon!
</dd><dd><b>Tank</b>: [snoring]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Come on! You're practically twins!
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I'm <i>purple</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: But if you don't have to hibernate, why should Tank?!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Because he's a tortoise and I'm a dragon!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Same family though, right?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: No!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'll take that as a yes.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Ugh! Look, if Fluttershy says tortoises hibernate, then I guarantee tortoises hiber—
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, what would you know?! You're a dragon!
</dd><dd>[door slams]

<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Nopony knows you like I do, Tank. All you need is some hard work to get the old blood pumping.
</dd><dd><b>Tank</b>: [snoring]
</dd><dd>[thudding]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Come on!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [huff] These things are heavy! Chock full of snowflakes! We're gonna have such a killer time in the snow, Tank. Tank? Tank!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Aww, look at the cute wittle Tankie, all snuggly-wuggly, getting ready to hibern—
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Don't say that word!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Which one? "Snuggly"? "Wuggly"? "Tankie"? "Hibernate"?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That one!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I was just saying how cute he—
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: If you think hiber... – you know, that napping thing – is so cute, why don't <i>you</i> go do it?! Somewhere far away from here?!
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [to rest of Mane Six] What are you looking at?! Pinkie Pie and I are just having a conversation!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Look, Rainbow Dash, we all know how upset you are about Tank hiber—
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Shhhh! Don't say that word! That's what started this all!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We all know how upset you are about Tank. But you shouldn't take your anger out on your friends.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Who said anything about anger?! I didn't say anything about anger! I'm not upset! <i>And I am not angry! <b>Do I look angry?!</b></i> [grumbles] Come on, Tank! Let's get out of here!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I need you bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,
not sleepy-eyed and scaly-tailed! Which... is exactly what you are. But
get up anyway!
</dd><dd><b>Tank</b>: [yawns]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You <i>can't</i> hiber– you know. What
about all the primo things we're gonna do together this winter? Building
 snow ponies, starting snowball fights, sipping hot cider by the fire.
</dd><dd><b>Tank</b>: [snores]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Don't you wanna do those things with me?!
Think, Rainbow Dash, think! Tank's only hibernating because it's cold,
right? Well, I'd rather have him awake in the heat than asleep in the
cold... [gasps] I just have to stop winter!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunshower</b>: So where do these clouds go?
</dd><dd><b>Open Skies</b>: Over by Clear Skies.
</dd><dd><b>Sunshower</b>: But there's clear skies everywhere.
</dd><dd><b>Clear Skies</b>: Yo, Clear Skies right here!
</dd><dd><b>Sunshower</b>: But there's clear skies over there, too!
</dd><dd><b>Clear Skies</b>: That's Open Skies!
</dd><dd><b>Sunshower</b>: There's open skies everywhere!
</dd><dd><b>Open Skies</b>: I'm not everywhere. I'm right here!
</dd><dd><b>Sunshower</b>: [sighs] Wait. So you're Open Skies, and you're Clear Skies. Then what's all that?
</dd><dd><b>Clear Skies</b> and <b>Open Skies</b>: Open, clear skies!
</dd><dd><b>Open Skies</b>: Hey, where'd our fluffy clouds go?
</dd><dd><b>Clear Skies</b>: Fluffy Clouds? He's over there!

</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Riding that entire season from Cloudsdale to Ponyville <i>was</i> pretty awesome.
</dd><dd><b>Tank</b>: [yawns]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I thought you guys might like to say goodbye to Tank. He's ready to hibernate.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ooh, you're using the word! Oh, she's using
the word! And when Tank finishes hibernating, I'm gonna throw him the
biggest welcome home party ever! Or wait. Should it be a 'welcome above
ground' party? Or a 'happy wake-up' party? Maybe an 'it's about time!'
party!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: And I'll design him a very special suit just for the occasion, whichever one it ends up being.

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well? Ready for some winter fun?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, I'm gonna hang here and read to him a

I'll be right there.
