</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh. Antoine believes what he eats is his business. Do other predators feel that way, too?
</dd><dd>[animals chattering]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Would anyprey like to respond? Muriel, does
it bother you when Antoine tries to eat you? Just because you're on
opposite ends of the food chain doesn't mean you can't work—
</dd><dd><b>Muriel</b>: [trumpets]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Huh? It doesn't mean you can't...
</dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: [roars]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [clears throat, strained] It doesn't mean you can't work togeth—
</dd><dd><b>Sandra</b>: [growls, chomps]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh! [sighs] I'm sorry, but the more you distract everyone, the longer this will take.
</dd><dd><b>Angel</b>: [angry chittering]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I <i>am</i> listening to you. But if you
really want to be heard, you should join our predator/prey support
group. Then you can talk to everyone here. You could teach all these
hungry predators the delights of a carrot-based cuisine. Sorry,
everyone. I think somebunny just wants a little attention. Now, since we
 all need to get along, what if all predators promise to only eat
vegetables while staying at the sanctuary?

</dd><dd><b>Dr. Fauna</b>: Zecora found this little guy and brought him to my office. But I thought he might do better at the sanctuary.
</dd><dd>[poof]
</dd><dd><b>Angel</b>: [coughing]
</dd><dd><b>Zecora</b>: Bringing him here seemed the right thing to do. I've never seen geckos breathe smoke though. Have you?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Ooh. I certainly haven't.
</dd><dd><b>Dr. Fauna</b>: I thought we could take a look at his diet. Plus, it's about time for me to give all the animals here a checkup.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: That's a wonderful idea.
</dd><dd>[lizard chirping]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: If we really want to know what's going on, we need to make sure the problem isn't your food.
</dd><dd>[stomach growls]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I wouldn't worry too much. It's probably
just something he's been eating. Oh. [grunts] Um, is there anything else
 we can do for you?
</dd><dd><b>Zecora</b>: Ahhh. Seeing what you two do, the real question is – can <i>I</i> help <i>you</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Angel</b>: [blows raspberry]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: You mean me and Angel?
</dd><dd><b>Zecora</b>: Mm-hmm.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, he's fine! We're fine! I... I just don't always have time to indulge him. But we're best friends!
</dd><dd><b>Zecora</b>: Even the best of friends need help from time to time. Come visit me in my hut, should you change your mind.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Okay, thanks! But Angel and I are great!
</dd><dd><b>Dr. Fauna</b>: Oh, goodness, Fluttershy. Is this the list of what you do every day? [chuckles] How do you find time for anything else?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Between here and teaching at the school, I'm not sure I do. You're gonna love it here, little gecko.
</dd><dd>[lizard chirps]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: What is it? Not fluffy enough?

</dd><dd><b>Antoine</b>: [chews, gulps]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: They're vegan. Pinkie Pie made a whole jar
of them. They're all yours if you promise. No more trying to eat Muriel

extract is in short supply! What's gotten into you? Every day this week,
 you've been causing trouble when I have work to do!
</dd><dd><b>Angel</b>: [chitters]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Of course I know you can't talk to anypony else. But that's not <i>my</i> fault. I have responsibilities!
</dd><dd><b>Angel</b>: [growls]

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Zecora</b>: No need to sit and silently stew. Tell each other what's bothering you.

</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Well, that's not true. We talk all the time.

</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: You feel like I'm the only pony you can talk to, and all I do is ignore you? Well, <i>I</i> feel like you don't care about my responsibilities.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [laughs nervously] Um, as you can see, we're kind of at an impasse.
</dd><dd><b>Zecora</b>: Ahhh, such luck, your coming here indeed. Behold, the antidote you need.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Is this what you meant by "help us"?
</dd><dd><b>Zecora</b>: When trouble brews between you two, turning
sister against brother, true understanding is what's due. Each must come
 to know the other. There's no time to waste. Go directly home. But you
both must taste when you're finally alone.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Not yet, Angel. Zecora told us to take it together when we got home.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Hmm. I suppose we could dust off the old
picnic blanket. It'll be just like old times. We'll drink the potion and
 settle in for a nice tea party. I can barely remember the last time we
did that. I've been so busy at the sanctuary. Though I really need to
keep an eye on Zecora's gecko, and I haven't finished any of today's
chores. If I don't, the animals won't get the care they need. Ohh. Maybe
 we should just save the potion until af— Angel! Zecora said to go home
first!
