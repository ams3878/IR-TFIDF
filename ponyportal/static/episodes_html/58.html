</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Whoo-hoo!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sips] Nice moves, kid.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Nice moves? Rainbow Dash thinks I've got–
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps] ...nice moves!

<dl><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: ...Then, all of a sudden, I'm airborne! And Rainbow Dash looks over and was like, "Nice moves, kid."
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Woooow.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: She really said that?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I mean, it's like she practically told me she
 wanted to take me under her wing, teach me everything she knows, and
become like my big sister!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: I dunno about all that.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: It was a really nice compliment and all, but...
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I know, I know. But all that stuff I said <i>could</i> happen, right?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Sure.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Absolutely.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I just need to find a way to spend some time with her, y'know, so she can see more of my <i>awesomeness</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Well... Applejack and I are supposed to be
campin' up at Winsome Falls this weekend. Maybe I could get my big sis
to invite Rainbow Dash, and then you could come, too!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Really?!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Sure!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I wanna go...
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Well, duh, of course you can go!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: And I'll get Rarity to come too! Rarity loves camping!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I <i>despise</i> camping! All of that... [shudders] ...nature.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Applejack's going with her little sister. But, y'know, if you don't wanna spend time with me... [squee]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, all right! Ooh! Of course I will need to find an outfit more appropriate for 'roughing it'. Ooh!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: See? Told you she'd wanna go.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[water running]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: You packed bug spray?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Yup. You got the canteens?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Yup. Looks like we're all set then.
</dd><dd>[cart trundling]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Hey!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Gee, Rarity, did you remember to pack?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, well, let's see who gets the last laugh when
 you're absolutely desperate to curl your lashes, and you realize you
didn't bring your eyelash curler.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, looks like we're all set <i>now</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: But what about Rainbow Dash? Isn't Rainbow Dash coming?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: 'Course she is, sugarcube. She's gonna meet us up at our first campsite.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Oh.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Alright, y'all, let's move 'em out!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, are we there yet?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: The last thousand times you asked that, the
answer was no. This time, it's actually yes. There's Rainbow Dash up
there right now.
</dd><dd>[crunch]
</dd><dd>[thump]
</dd><dd>[splash]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [quietly] Alright, Scootaloo, just play it cool. [normal] Hey Rai–
</dd><dd>[wobbling noise]
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [clears throat] Hey, Rainbow Dash! What's up?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What took you guys so long?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, <i>some</i> of us didn't pack as light as the others. So we were slowed down a bit.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[hammering]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Looks like you'll be sharing a tent with me, huh?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Heh, if that's okay with you.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Sure! Long as you don't snore. You don't snore, do you?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Nope. No way. Not me. Never snored a day or [laughs nervously] night in my life.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Then you and I are gonna get along just fine.
</dd><dd>[pop]
</dd><dd>[wind blowing]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You have <i>got</i> to be kidding me.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Sweetie Belle, do be a dear and see if you can find some fresh flowers for my bedside vase.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [mimicking Rarity] Scootaloo, do be a sweetheart and see if you can gather some firewood.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b> and <b>Scootaloo</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Seriously though. Can you get us some wood for the fire?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Of course!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[fire lighting]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Okay, everybody get comfortable, 'cause I'm about to tell you the best story you've ever heard.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Is it about the time when Rarity had wings, and then they got ruined, and then you saved her from plummeting to her doom?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Okay, maybe it's the <i>second</i> best story you've ever heard. But probably still the scariest. [spookily] You like scary stories, <i>right</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps] Mm-hmm.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: It all happened on a night just like this one, in a forest, just like this...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: ...And then, The Olden Pony asked, [mimicking aged voice] "<i>Who's got my rusty horseshoe?</i>"
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Not me!
</dd><dd>[suspenseful pause]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: <i>You do</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b> and <b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [screaming]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [clears throat] Something in my throat. I wasn't scared at all, heheh. Good story.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Knew <i>you</i> wouldn't be scared. The way you jumped that cart the other day, you're like me – fearless.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [nervously] Yeah. Fearless. [teeth chattering]
</dd><dd>[owl hoots]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [coddling] Don't worry. Rarity is here to keep you safe and sound. Ooh!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [yawns] Think it's about time for me to hit the straw.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: [trembling]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Don't you worry, little sis. There's no 'Olden Pony' in our tent.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [nervously] Haa, that sure was funny, wasn't it? Heheh. How they were all afraid of The Olden Pony? Heh, but not me, heh!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That's because you're tough, just like when I was your age!
</dd><dd>[splash]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [yelps]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'm hitting the sack. Come in whenever you feel like it.
</dd><dd>[twig snaps]
</dd><dd>[leaves rustling]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [nervously] It's, it's nothing... Just my imagination...
</dd><dd>[branches creaking]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [nervously] And that isn't the thundering stomp of The Olden Pony...
</dd><dd>[wolf howling]
</dd><dd>[zip]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [snoring loudly]
</dd><dd>[distant muttering]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I-Is anyone out there?
</dd><dd>[hoof stamps]
</dd><dd>[branches creaking]
</dd><dd><b>The Olden Pony</b>: [mumbling]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasp] [panting]
</dd><dd><b>The Olden Pony</b>: Who got my rusty horseshoe?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasp] [panting] [neighs]
</dd><dd>[roar]
</dd><dd>[snap]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [sighs]
</dd><dd><b>The Olden Pony</b>: <i>Who's got my rusty horseshoe</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [cries] [dash] [panting] Rainbow Dash–?
</dd><dd><b>The Olden Pony</b>: <i>You do</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [yelps]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [snores]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [nervous humming]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [nervous humming]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [yawns] What's that noise? Is there a bug in here? [sighs] I dunno about you, but I slept like a filly.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [nervously] Best night ever.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Glad you're rested up, because we've got a <i>long</i> trek ahead. Totally gonna be worth it when we get to Winsome Falls.
</dd><dd>[eerie noises]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Yeah... Totally... [twitches]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Ohh... Am I sweating? Oh! <i>I think I'm sweating</i>!
 Oh, uh, but it's absolutely worth it to get to spend time with my
little sister. It's just that this cart feels like it's getting heavier
all the <i>time</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I don't care if that's cart's as heavy as a
pack of mules. If we don't get a move on, it'll be dark before we get to
 the campsite!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps] Dark?! [wings buzzing] I'll just ride
 ahead and make sure the path is clear. We don't wanna be out here after
 dark, right?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Doesn't matter to me.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Well, y'know, [hushed] it's for the scaredy-ponies, heheh.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [yawns]
</dd><dd>[thump]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps] Don't fall asleep now... We've got to get to that campsite before dark... [snores, continues over]
</dd><dd>[bonk]
</dd><dd><b>Crocodile</b>: [growls]
</dd><dd><b>Bear</b>: [licks lips] [chomps] [grunts]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [fades in] That's why it's always important to bring your own trunk on any public outing.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps] Um... don't come this way! Take the path! It's, heh, way better than going through the bushes.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[twig snaps]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [yelps]
</dd><dd>[poof]
</dd><dd>[crunch]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: You're more nervous than a worm in an apple on cider making day. What gives, Scootaloo?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Heh, nothing, just thought I heard something, aheh.
</dd><dd>[owl hoots]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [yelps]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: You sure you're okay? You seem a little jumpy.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Just getting my exercise! You know how important it is to stretch out those hindquarters every so often, aheh.
</dd><dd>[frog croaking]
</dd><dd>[bells ringing]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Uh, d-do you need a little help?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: That's so sweet, thank you.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Um... what are friends for? [sounds of exertion]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[cart creaking]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: No need for tents tonight, y'all. We'll just take shelter in that cave.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: All <i>right</i>! A deep, dark cave! Perfect for the story I've got for tonight. All we need is a campfire, and we're good to go.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [gulps] [nervously] Uh, of course...
</dd><dd>[wolf howling]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [nervously] I'll be right back with lots of firewood from the deep... dark... not-scary-at-all forest!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Thanks.
</dd><dd>[creatures growling]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [breathing heavily] [sighs] Okay. I can do
this. On the count of three, I get those branches. One... two... three!
[trembling] [sighs] [nervously] Here, branches branches branches...
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Bbbbrrr! Hoo-wee! It's colder than a timberwolf's toenail. Bbbrr! Where's that Scootaloo?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [panicked laughing] Here you go!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That's <i>it</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: It's all I could find, 'cause, y'know, there aren't that many trees around here!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: It's all we need. Why don't you sit with Rainbow Dash for a while?
</dd><dd>[fire starts]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Now, where was I? Oh yeah, the [spookily] scary part. [laughs evilly]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Hey, I have an idea! How about I tell tonight's story?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Alright, just make sure it's a horrible one.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: There once was a really really nice pony who
lived in a bright and sunny land, where there are rainbows every day,
and lots and lots of happy friends, and–
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: No offense, but it's not a real campfire
story unless somepony's shaking. [spookily] I've been told that these
very woods are haunted...
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [gulps]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [spookily] ...by The <i>Headless Horse</i>! It gallops only at night–
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: If it doesn't have a head, then how in tarnation does this pony know where it's goin'?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: It's headless, not <i>brainless</i>. [spookily] ...looking for little lost ponies–
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: So where's its brain?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ugh. [spookily] Fear was dripping from the air...[crossfades out]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [spookily] [crossfades in] ...and they were never heard from ever again!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [gasps] Never?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: <i>Never</i>.
</dd><dd>[fire sparks]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b> and <b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [screaming] [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [trembling]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Don't worry, you'll be safe with me tonight.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: It's not time for bed yet, is it?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: 'Fraid so, Scootaloo.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Uh, but we haven't even sung any campfire songs yet! [squeak]
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: You don't have to ask me twice!
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [out of rhythm and out of tune]
Ninety-nine buckets of oats on the wall, ninety-nine buckets of oats!
Take one down, [crossfades] pass it around, you got eighty-one buckets
of oats on the wall, [crossfades] forty-one buckets of oats! Take one
down, pass it around you got forty [pauses] buckets of oats on the wall!
 [crossfades] ...buckets of oats! Take one down, pass it around, you've
got zero buckets of oats on the <i>waaaaaaaalllllll</i>!!!! [snores]
</dd><dd><b>Other ponies</b>: [yawning]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Good night, Sweetie Belle.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Good night, y'all.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Good night, y'all.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Sleep tight.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Oh, just one more song! Anyone? [whoosh] How
about a dance contest? I know you love to cut a rug, so how 'bout we
mess up a cave floor? I have a brilliant idea! Hide and seek! Who's with
 me?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: [yawns] Maybe tomorrow.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Aww.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Seems like you don't really wanna go to sleep tonight. Is there some reason why?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Pfft, of course not! I just <i>love</i>
camping and hanging out with Rainbow Dash so much that I don't wanna
waste a single minute with sleep! [yawns] Heh, silly sleep.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That's cool and all, Scoot, but this pony needs her shut-eye and she needs it now!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Ugh, this is so unfair... [yawns] I'm falling asleep... [snores]
</dd><dd>[water dripping]

<dl><dd>[hoofsteps]
</dd><dd>[hoofsteps increase speed]
</dd><dd>[vehicle accelerating]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps] If The Headless Horse catches me, I'm never gonna be heard from again! And <i>I wanna be heard from</i>! Woah, woaaah! Ugh! [grunts] Woah!
</dd><dd>[running hoofsteps]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: It's all over! [cries hysterically]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [panting] Aaah!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: [echoing] A warm welcome to you, Scootaloo.
</dd><dd>[poof]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Princess Luna! I thought you were The Headless Horse!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: You were mistaken, but I hope not disappointed.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: You are so, so much better than The Headless Horse. But what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be in Canterlot?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: I am the princess of the night. Thus it is my duty to come into your dreams.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Oh, yeah... Wait, is this just a dream? But it feels so real!
</dd><dd>[reverberating drumbeat]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: I assure you that you are asleep. But when you awake, the thing that frightens you most will still exist.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [nervously] Eh... The Headless Horse?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: Hmmm... Is The Headless Horse <i>really</i> what frightens you the most?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Mm-mm. I'm afraid Rainbow Dash will find out I'm not as tough as she thinks I am.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: <i>Everypony has fears, Scootaloo. Everypony must face them in their own way.</i> But they must be faced, or the nightmares will continue.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [nervous whine]
</dd><dd>[rocks tumbling]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: <i>Face your fears</i>!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: –Princess Luna?! [sighs] It was just a dream.
</dd><dd>[water dripping]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps] But The Headless Horse isn't! Rainbow Dash said it lives <i>here</i>, in <i>these very woods</i>!
</dd><dd>[distant whinnying]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: It's the wicked whinny of The Headless Horse! [wings motoring]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [whinny-like snoring]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [panting] So it's a horse without a head...
which means it doesn't have a mouth... and if it doesn't have a mouth,
then... it's not a horse-eat-pony kind of horse... but still... it's a
horse <i>without a head</i>!
</dd><dd>[tires screeching]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Whoa, whoa! [whining]
</dd><dd>[river rushing]
</dd><dd>[splash]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Hello?! Is anyone out there? [nervously] Anyone except The Headless Horse?
</dd><dd>[branch cracking]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Heellllp–
</dd><dd>[splash]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps for breath]
</dd><dd>[splashing]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [screams, fades out]
</dd><dd>[whoosh]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I gotcha!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Rainbow Dash! Is that you? Thank you, thank you!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What were you doing out here in the middle of the night?!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: [echoing] It is time for you to face your real fear, Scootaloo!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [sighs] I'm so, so sorry, Rainbow Dash! I
just wanted you to hang out with me and see how cool I was so you'd take
 me under your wing, teach me everything you know, and become like my
big sister! [takes breath] But then you started telling those spooky
stories and I got scared! I thought I heard The Headless Horse so I ran
out here by myself, and... [crying] ...well, I guess you know the rest.
[sniffling]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hey, I'm gonna tell you something, but if
you ever tell anypony else, I'm gonna deny it. First time I heard those
stories... I was scared too.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [sniffles] You were?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Sure! I mean, I got over it because I realized pretty quick that if there <i>was</i> such thing as a Headless Horse, I could totally take it on. So, you're looking for somepony to take you under their wing, huh?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Mm-hmm.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, I might be up for something like that.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: <i>Really</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: As long as you don't go falling into any more rivers in the middle of the night.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [giggles] It's a deal!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[waterfalls rushing]
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I call sister teams! Last herd to make it to the falls is a moldy carrot!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Ugh, if you insist. [giggles] It is so on!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: They think <i>they</i> can beat the two of <i>us</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [wings fluttering]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>The Olden Pony</b>: [grumbling] <i>Who's got my rusty horseshoe</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Here it is, for pony's sake. Now take it and stop all your moaning.
</dd><dd><b>The Olden Pony</b>: Thank you, and have a nice day.
