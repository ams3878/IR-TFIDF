<dl><dd>Oh-oh-oh
</dd><dd>Oh-oh-oh
</dd><dd>You are my Equestria Girls
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>You turn the light switch on
</dd><dd>It brightens up my day like the sun
</dd><dd>When my friends come a-runnin'
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>You were right all along
</dd><dd>That together we're always better
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>We could turn a sketch into a masterpiece
</dd><dd>When you're here, I feel like I'm complete
</dd><dd>You are my Equestria Girls!
</dd></dl>
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: Experience the world like you've
never seen it before, at the one, the only, Equestria Land! Stop! Cut!
Cut! Why is everyone dressed like they're not dressed?!
</dd><dd><b>Designer</b>: [Russian accent] Because you keep changing your mind about the costumes, Vignette Valencia.
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: Do you know what it means to be in charge of public relations for this park? It's <i>my</i>
 job to make sure the world knows how amazing Equestria Land is gonna
be. And in two weeks, when there's fifty thousand people here for
opening day, the last thing they'll see before they leave at night will
be this light parade. And, by extension, your costumes, which apparently
 do not exist as of this moment! B.Y.B.B. Be yourself, but better. Do
you even <i>have</i> a philosophy?
</dd><dd><b>Designer</b>: G.W.I.Q. Guess vhat. I qvit.
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: [sighs, inhales] <i>I need a stress salad!</i>
 Where am I gonna find a new costume designer for the light parade with
only two weeks left? [to performer] I'm not promoting you. [sighs] If
only I could put a filter on real life to make everything the way I want
 it.
</dd><dd>[magic swirl]
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: Only way to feel better is getting ten thousand likes with the perfect salad pic.
</dd><dd>[digital magic noises]
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: Hey, did somebody install a new app on my phone?
</dd><dd>[electronic buzzing]
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: Oh. 'Cause I like it!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[patrons conversing]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Anything?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Nothin'. You?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Nuh-uh.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Somebody has unspilled beans at this table, and it's not me, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, Twilight Sparkle, or Sunset Shimmer!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [deep breath] Rarity and I applied for summer jobs at the new theme park.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Equestria Land? Wait... Will you get to go there for free?!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Actually, <i>they</i> pay <i>us</i> to go there.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [excited squealing]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: We applied to work side-by-side as caramel apple girls.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Yes. It's not that I'm nervous, but... Applejack, you're perfect for the job. And, well, my résumé is less apple-centric.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [chuckles] We'll be together. I got a good feelin'.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [huffs] No missed calls while we were talking about caramel apples. Shall we practice answering our phones and sounding calm?
</dd><dd>[phone vibrates and alerts]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b> and <b>Applejack</b>: [scream]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: That was about as calm as Pinkie Pie on Cake Day.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Was it today? Did I miss it?! [sips]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: One new e-mail!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: It's from the park!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b> and <b>Applejack</b>: You open yours first! No, <i>you</i> open <i>yours</i> first! [laugh]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Okay, okay. Same time. One, two...
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Too late! I opened mine! [screams] Oh. They said
 I'm overqualified for caramel apple girl. [gasps] They want me to be
lead parade costume designer!
</dd><dd><b>Equestria Girls</b>: [excited chatter]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You haven't even started, and you already got promoted!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That's <i>gotta</i> be a record.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I didn't get the job. But I'm really happy for you, Rarity.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, pffft. There must be a mix-up, darling.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Obviously, the internet mailman gave you the
 wrong letter. I know that's not how the internet works, but I'm trying
to cheer you up.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Technically, Rarity didn't get the
job, either, since she got a different job. So they're probably about to
 send another e-mail with <i>your</i> promotion.
</dd><dd>[phone vibrates and alerts]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [gasps, groans] Just a sale at Stinky Bottom's Discount Hat Emporium.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Forty percent off! Oh, sorry. Not helping.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, I'm not going to accept it without you, obviously. Pfft.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: What?! You cannot let this opportunity pass
you by, Rarity. Think of all those vision boards, the late-night sewin'.
 This has been your dream since... since kindy-garten.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Mmm... Preschool, actually. But that's not the
point. My mind is made up. We planned to spend the summer together,
and... that's what we're going to do. Riiiiiiiight? [blink, blink]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: You're takin' the job, and that's final.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Okay, if you insist! [squeals] I'm gonna be a costume designer!
</dd><dd><b>Equestria Girls</b>: [excited chatter]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Heh-heh. All right. I probably shouldn'ta quit my old job this mornin', huh?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I'm sure they haven't replaced you already.
</dd><dd>[splat!]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Eh.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: My name is Vignette Valencia, and to answer your first question, yes, I'm <i>that</i> "Vignette", but no, I do not think I'm better than you just because I have three million followers on Snapgab.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [huffs] You're up to three million now? I mean, yes, uh, yes, I-I <i>am</i> familiar with your online repertoire.
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: I have a good feeling about you,
Rare. Oh, you have to let me call you "Rare". It's the perfect name for
lead parade costume designer. Not a... um, caramel apple girl. I don't
even know why you applied for a job like that. Not with a Snapgab feed
like yours.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh.
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: Obviously, I looked you up. Great
pictures, by the way. That gingham and linen sundress caught my eye, and
 your follower count is [faux French pronunciation] im-press-ive. For
someone just starting out, of course. But I can already tell you've got <i>magique</i> inside.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oof. <i>Magi</i>— You <i>can</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: The light parade is the most important event in the park. Over a hundred cast members, and <i>you</i> are gonna make them look perfect.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [sighs]
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: Oh. And before I forget, don't put
anything on that table. Especially your phone. No reason. Just a
super-important rule I made up, 'kay?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[squishing]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [grunting]
</dd><dd>[phone rings]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Rarity!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Applejack! Darling! How's work on the farm?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [insincere] Fantastic! [grunting] I could not
 be happier... makin' foot-stompin' applesauce the old-fashioned way
with my family.
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Less chatter, more splatter!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, good. I'm so happy for you.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: And I'm happy for you and your new job, too.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, yes, well... [nervous laughter] It's certainly a big job.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I'm sure you won't slip up. Whoa!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, I-I was calling, because, you see, well,
it's not that I'm... [nervous sounds] nervous or anything silly like
that, but I-I-I was wondering if... if you and the girls wanted to come
on opening night to see the parade. V.I.P. passes! You can cut the
lines!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: You bet your britches, missy! I wouldn't miss your big night for the world! Whoa!
</dd><dd>[splash!]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Ugh...
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Applejack? Darling? Hello?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[patrons yelling and conversing]
</dd><dd>[thunder crashes]
</dd><dd>[deep evil laughter]
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>, <b>Sweetie Drops</b>, and <b>Lyra Heartstrings</b>: [scream]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Equestria Land opening day! What should we
do first? Appleloosa Wild West Stunt Show? Nightmare Moon's Haunted
Castle? Sugarcube Everything?!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Now, hang on. I got the sense Rarity's
overwhelmed, which is understandable. I mean, she's all alone here
without any of her friends. Which is why I wouldn'ta taken the job, but
that's just me. Uh, point is, we're here to support Rarity.
</dd><dd>[girls yelling gleefully]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: What? Uh, which character is that?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ah, it's not a character, silly! That's
Vignette Valencia! She's famous on Snapgab, which you'd know if you
actually logged in once in a while. You're missing my "One Cupcake Every
 Day" series.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: She posts a lot of pictures of her Welsh corgi named Yas Queen.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: And she's friends with, like, every awesome athlete in the world!
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Don't look at <i>me</i>. I only follow bots that post interesting science facts.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: These are her pictures? "Chillin sandy
style"? "U no how I do"? "I came I saw I vintaged"? Okay, somebody tell
me why this picture has twenty thousand likes.
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: [on phone] #Bangs.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh, I don't know. Spendin' all that time just to look good in a picture ain't my idea of fun.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: <i>There</i> you are!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Here comes the lead parade costume designer!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Guilty as charged! [giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: So? You've been here solo without your best friends all this time. How can we help?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Hold that thought. Vignette! Over here!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: You know Vignette Valencia?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Pfft. Do I <i>know</i> her?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b> and <b>Vignette Valencia</b>: Mwah! Mwah!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Why, she's my best friend at the park!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: Selfie! Oh, but can we use <i>your</i> phone? Mine's been acting super-weird lately. Thanks. You're the best!
</dd><dd>[phone camera snaps]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [growls]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Everyone, this is Vignette Valencia. She runs P.R. for the park, and she's my boss.
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: I told you not to use the "B" word. I'm your... "friend"... who gets to boss you around!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [nervous laugh]
</dd><dd><b>All except Applejack</b>: [nervous laughter]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I don't get it.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Heh. So this is Sunset Shimmer, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Twilight Sparkle, and Fluttershy.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [clears throat irritably]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh! Ha. And Applejack. Sorry, you were standing a— I-I didn't see you.
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: Hmmm.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: They're my best friends. So... I thought you'd like to meet them.
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: [uninterested] Mm-hmm.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Uhhhh, fun fact – uh, we perform together in a band called the Rainbooms.
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: Rainbooms? Why is that familiar? A
hundred thousand followers? Focused consumer-centric demographic, too?
Does your curated content consistently aggregate across multiple
platforms?
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: We sing songs together!
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: [gasps] I am going to turn you into the centerpiece of tonight's light parade!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, the Rainbooms?
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: Shhh... Are you ready? B.Y.B.B. Be
yourself, but better! That's been my power phrase since I started my
first company. A middle school girl selling artisanal handmade mascara.
"But isn't that just melted crayons?" Hey, neighsayers gonna neigh. But I
 say B.Y.B.B.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, how many people will be watching us?
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: All of them! What do you say?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Well, if it's gonna help out Rarity...
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>, <b>Pinkie Pie</b>, <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>, and <b>Fluttershy</b>: [agree]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hmph.
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: Like, like, like, like, like, like.
Upload and post it, ladies. This'll trend fer sure! I'll @ you later
with the exact deets. B.Y.B.B, Rare. V, out.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I know. She's amazing, right?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: She sure is... somethin'.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Logistical question: How're we supposed to get our instruments?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Pfft, kuh! Vignette will handle everything.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I got a question, too. When you said she's your "best friend at the park", did you mean "best friend, comma, at the park"?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Did <i>I</i> say that? [gasps] Listen, tonight's a huge opportunity. And not just for me now, but for <i>all</i> of us!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Let's go see the park!
</dd><dd>[zoom!]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [to Applejack] Honestly, I don't know why you're giving me your frowny eyebrows.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [sighs] It's nothin'.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Uhhh, well, uh... enjoy the park. I'm gonna be
super-busy preparing for tonight. So let's meet in the staging area for
sound check and run-throughs. I have three minutes' break at four
o'clock, and I can give you two of them. B.Y.B.B.! [laughs] Rare, out!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [sighs]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, looks like Rarity doesn't need us as much as you thought. So...
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Should we practice for the parade? It's a little... [gasps] ...daunting, isn't it?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: We know every song by heart. Wouldn't you rather go have some fun?
</dd><dd><b>Equestria Girls except Applejack</b>: [cheer]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Great idea!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[patrons screaming]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [shudders]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [yelling] Pretty great, right?!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [shudders, yelling] What?!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [yelling] Can you hear me over all the screaming?!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [yelling] I can't hear you over all the
screaming! [normally] Oh. I wish I'd gone with Sunset and Twilight. Or
Pinkie Pie. Or anyone else in the entire park.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Look at it this way. It's the perfect opportunity to conquer your fear.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Can't I conquer something a little smaller first?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hey, good idea! A warm-up before the big
game! Ooh! What did you have in mind? Dragon Lands Drag Racing? Ooh, the
 Appleloosa Runaway Train! Ooh, Neighagara Falls Barrel Flume?!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Mm-mm.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [screaming, hyperventilating] Oh, these kids are so brave.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ugh.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Applejack, this parade is a living, breathing
dance of light and sound! [to assistants] Love it, lock it, stitch it.
Beautiful, perfect, I just threw up, love it. Now hurry up! I need these
 done yesterday!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: You were born for this, Rarity. Anythin' I can do to help?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Play a great show tonight? [to mascot] Excuse
me! I know I am not seeing a lapped zipper on that faux fur! A lapped
zipper is simply a stuck zipper waiting to happen! Ugh! [to Applejack]
This is what I'm up against.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: So, uh... wanna take a break and go get a caramel apple?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I'd love to, darling, but I am a tad super-insanely busy. Heh.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Of course. I-I just thought... Uh, never mind. You're right. I wouldn't wanna rain on your parade.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Rain?! I didn't plan for rain! [to assistant] Get me one hundred ponchos, stat!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[rollercoaster chugging]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'm proud of you. You know that? You're
facing your fears head-on. Just like I always did as a kid. I mean,
look, a four-hundred-foot vertical drop right into these loop-de-loops
and a corkscrew? You're probably super-nervous about that, I bet. Heh.
And that next part where it goes backwards? Uh, how are you feeling,
Fluttershy?
</dd><dd>[seagull squawking]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Is it even safe to be this high up? You're
 probably thinking, "Stop the ride! I want to get off!" That's what you
want, right? Right now? You're about to yell it? Stop the ride!
Seriously! Please, somebody stop the ride! <i>STOP THE RIIIIIIIDE!</i>
</dd><dd>[rollercoaster stops]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sighs]
</dd><dd>[wobbling sounds]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: That was actually kind of... fun. [giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Totally! That's why I didn't want to get off! I was just saying what <i>you</i> would've said. [nervous laugh] That's all.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: You were very brave.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Heh. You, too... by the way.
</dd><dd>[thud!]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [giggles]
</dd><dd>[phone rings and buzzes]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Hmmm...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh... Hmmm...
</dd><dd>[map crumples]
</dd><dd><b>Micro Chips</b>: Apples! Caramel apples over here! We've got red and green and everything in between!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Micro Chips?
</dd><dd><b>Micro Chips</b>: Caramel apple?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh, <i>Applejack</i>. <i>You're</i> who they hired to be the caramel apple... girl?
</dd><dd><b>Micro Chips</b>: Vignette said she wanted cool nerd chic. I'd say she found it. Wouldn't you?
</dd><dd>[squish]
</dd><dd><b>Micro Chips</b>: [grunting]
</dd><dd>[clattering and splatting]
</dd><dd><b>Micro Chips</b>: [clears throat] Do you by any chance have a knife or samurai sword or several tiny but very sharp nail clippers?
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: [talking indistinctly]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: I know what you're thinking. "But,
Vignette, how can I ever thank you for coming up with such a brilliant
idea for the parade?"
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I don't understand. You want me to pretend I'm someone else tonight?
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: Everyone in the band has a new role.
It's part of my BOLD, NEW VISION! All caps, Helvetica, sixty-five.
"Fluttershy: Bad Girl". Spiked hair, ripped tights. I've already
commissioned an A-list graffiti/sneaker artist to tag up a custom
guitar. How do you feel about skulls? B.Y.B.B.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Uh, maybe I, um... shouldn't do it. At all.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: You're right. If collab-ing isn't
your thing, that's your life decision to make. But I just thought of a
way for us both to get exactly what we want.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: You did?
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: Of course! Getting what I want is what I do best, sweetie. Now say "cheese!"
</dd><dd>[electronic zapping]
</dd><dd><b>Vignette Valencia</b>: Sorry, Fluttershy. You'll thank me later.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [echoing] Um, excuse me? Vignette? Where am I?
</dd><dd>[bowl clattering]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Ooh! And do you mind if I eat this salad? I'm feeling stressed.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Flim</b>: Step right up! Don't be shy!
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: You like prizes? We got prizes!
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: Toss this ring onto any one of these bottles! Easiest game in the park!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Wow! This game <i>does</i> look easy!
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: Would ya lookee here? Somebody who knows a thing or two about a thing or two!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [sighs] Twilight, they're just giving ya the old bump-and-tingle to lure you in. These games are rigged.
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: Slanderous!
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: Libelous!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Do you know what's <i>not</i> rigged?
The laws of physics. Assuming no air resistance and a vertical
displacement of zero, horizontal displacement equals initial projectile
velocity squared times the sine of twice the launch angle divided by the
 acceleration due to gravity.
</dd><dd>[music]
</dd><dd>[fwip!]
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: Oh, the suspense!
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: The drama!
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: I can't watch!
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: Hold me!
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b> and <b>Flam</b>: [fake shudder]
</dd><dd>[boing!]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Errgh!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: You were pretty close, though. Maybe we should try one more time?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[assistants chattering, handiwork noises]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Finished! [sighs] Let there be light!
</dd><dd>[buzzing]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [sighs] Maybe tonight won't be a disaster after all.
</dd><dd>[crackling, short circuits]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [eye twitches] Will you, uh, excuse me for a moment? [muffled] <i><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Of all the outlandish circumstances in the universe, why are all the wretched things happening to me?!</span></i>
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Huh? Hey, Rarity. How's—?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I wasn't having a meltdown! Who said I was having a meltdown?! <i><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">I am not having a meltdown!</span></i>
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Whoa. Uh, have you seen Fluttershy? See, she went wanderin' off with Vignette and then just disappeared.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Are you honestly asking me this right now?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Oh, it's not that I don't trust Vignette, if that's what you're thinkin'.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: We're in a giant fun park with fifty thousand
people. 'Course you can't find her. [gasps] Fifty thousand people!
[gasps] All looking at my costumes!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Are you seriously not concerned about Fluttershy?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: That's a hundred thousand individual eyeballs, Applejack.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, if you ain't gonna worry about her, I will!

</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: All right! What's next? What are we doing? How are we going to win this?!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Guess who just mapped out a perfect projectile trajectory taking into account propulsion, gravity, <i>and</i>
 aerodynamic drag! This gal! Betcha thought I forgot about friction, air
 drag, and veering initial velocities. Well, guess what. I didn't!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: What she said!
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: You know what they say...
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: Hundredth time's the charm.

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b> and <b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: <i>Applejack!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Oh. Sorry. Have you seen Fluttershy? Nobody's
 seen her all afternoon. Her phone's goin' straight to voicemail. I keep
 thinkin' somethin' real bad mighta happened.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Lighten up, Applejack. There's not always a villain with Equestrian magic out to get us.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: On a side note, do you have tickets we could borrow? Kinda used 'em all.

</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh, have you seen Fluttershy anywhere?

<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [whistles] No frowning allowed! Hmmm... As "Fun Inspector", I'm a little concerned about what I'm seeing here.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Pinkie Pie? Don't tell me you're workin' for the park now, too.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [laughing] No, silly! Fun Inspectors are
freelance! And don't get paid! And totally made up by me earlier today
when I saw a little girl crying because she dropped her ice cream, and I
 said to myself, "Pinkie Pie, this place isn't as fun as it could be!"
Do you like the uniform? I made it out of things I found in the trash,
but you can't even tell!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Geh, uhhh... so, have you seen Fluttershy anywhere?

VoIP connection to your IP address!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh... Magic. Got it.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Listen. We've come up with a plan to
set all this right. You'll need to remotely install a virus that creates
 a backdoor admin account, which you can use to reset all the
permissions on her phone and make a proxy backup. That should get us out
 of here! How much coding do you know?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh, none. Uh, I can rub two sticks together.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [voice both on phone and nearby] Oh, boy. Okay. Get a pencil.

</dd><dd><b>Micro Chips</b>: I was just minding my own business making
perfect caramel apples, when suddenly, Vignette saw me and said I wasn't
 as cool a nerd as she thought. Then she took my picture, and I ended up
 here, violating all known laws of space and time.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Guys, this is bad! It means Vignette is on the parade route, and she's using her phone to change whatever she doesn't like!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: What happens if she decides she doesn't like the crowd?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Everyone in the park is watching that parade! If her phone teleports that many people into this tiny room at the same time...!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] Squish city!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Our friends are in that crowd! Sweetie Belle is in that crowd! We've got to stop her!
