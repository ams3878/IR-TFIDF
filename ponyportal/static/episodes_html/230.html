</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: [groans] Those girls! Ugh! Ahh! First, they get me kicked off the <i>Daring Do</i>
 set. Now... Ooh! They're everywhere! I bet they'll be at the premiere
tonight. I bet I'll be the lucky one ushering them to their seats. Ugh!
[slapping and shaking]
</dd><dd><b>Boss</b>: [on walkie-talkie] Juniper, where are you? We need you back at the popcorn popper stat.
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: [imitates radio static] What was
that... [imitates static] boss? Can't hear you! [imitates static] Losing
 you! [imitates static] [to herself] If those girls hadn't shown up, <i>I</i>
 would have played Daring Do! Tonight would have been about me. I would
have been a star! [to kiosk clerk] You're right. They are a bit much.
</dd><dd>[magic sounds]
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: [screams] What <i>was</i> that? [screams]
</dd><dd><b>Reflection Juniper Montage</b>: Mmwah!
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: Incredible! [to kiosk clerk] Keep the change. Something tells me this thing's worth it.

<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [voiceover] <i>Dear Princess Twilight,
tonight's the night of the big movie premiere. All my friends are really
 excited, and I should be, too. Except I can't seem to keep my mind on
anything other than our new powers, and the rogue magic that's loose in
this world, and how scary but exhilarating it all is. How does it work?
How can we be prepared for it? When will it show up again? Well, you see
 the problem. With the weight of all Equestria on your shoulders, you
must have some advice on how to—</i> [out loud] Oh, no! [sighs] Shoot.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: What's the matter, Sunset Shimmer?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Oh, I just ran out of pages in my journal. That's all.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Chillax, SunShim.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, who's "SunShim"?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That's Sunset Shimmer's new movie star name. [sips] I just made it up!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: For sweet apples' sake, we only have <i>bit</i> parts in this flick. We're not movie stars.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: <i>Yet</i>, darling. Yet.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: There's more bothering you than just journal pages, isn't there, Sunset?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Um...
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: C'mon! Share your troubles. It might help soothe your stressed nerves.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Uh, I don't wanna take any of the fun out of our big night...
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>I said spill it, SunShim!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Okay, okay. It's just that things have been calm around here, magic-wise.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: And that's bad how, precisely?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: It's not. It's just that instead of
enjoying the fact that things are calm, I'm constantly thinking about
things going wrong, even when they aren't.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Ooh, like... like what things?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I don't know. I shouldn't even be thinking about any of this stuff right now. And neither should any of you.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Look! Twilight's writing you back! Hey, everybody, Sunset's getting an Equestritext!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: What's it say?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Princess Twilight wants me to come to... Equestria.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[cameras flashing]
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: It's like this mirror is the only one around here who gets me.
</dd><dd><b>Boss</b>: [clears throat irritably] Popcorn spill at the condiment counter.
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: Does this look like someone who cleans popcorn spills?
</dd><dd><b>Boss</b>: No. It looks like someone about to fire somebody.
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: Ugh! [sighs] This is the worst. Hey, I know what will perk me up! A little Mirror Me time!
</dd><dd><b>Fans</b>: [clamoring] Can I please have your autograph? [etc.]
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: [giggles] That's more like it! [sighs] I wish this popcorn would just clean itself up so I could just stare at you all day.
</dd><dd>[magic sounds]
</dd><dd><b>Boss</b>: Whuh? Done already? I'm shocked.
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: You and me both! [nervous laugh]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [sighs, yells]
</dd><dd>[magic sounds]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Whoa! Oof!
</dd><dd>[crash!]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [groans] Princess Twilight? Is that you?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Nope! Starlight Glimmer.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [laughs nervously] Oops. Whoa. Whoa!
Phew. Whoa. That feels a little weird after all this time. Starlight
Glimmer. You're Twilight's student, right?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Uh-huh. She wanted me to give you this.
</dd><dd>[magic sounds]
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [groaning]
</dd><dd>[magic sounds]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: She wanted to give it to you herself,
 but then she and her friends were called away to solve a friendship
problem. That happens a lot around here.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: That must be stressful, huh? Never
knowing when you might be called on to save the day. Dropping everything
 at a moment's notice. How does she do it?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Sorry. She just told me to give you the journal.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Heh-heh. So, are you sure she won't be back anytime soon?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Pretty sure.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: O...kay... I guess I'll be going now.
</dd><dd>[whiffle!]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What's it like back there?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: It's pretty different. And not so different at the same time. It's kinda hard to explain.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Heh. Guess you kinda have to go there to really get it, huh? I, uh, don't suppose...
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: You really think Princess Twilight would be okay with that?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I don't know for sure that she <i>wouldn't</i> be okay with it.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: That's not a particularly compelling argument.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: She wants me to learn as much as I can about friendship. And I'm not learning a whole lot just hanging out here in her castle.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Well, I haven't ever seen you in that world. So chances are you aren't gonna run into yourself.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: ...is something you don't hear everyday.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: So, just lay low. Don't draw too much attention to your—
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [scoffs] You'll barely even notice I'm there!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Introducing you to my friends could be a nice distraction.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: But you'll also totally notice I'm
there, and it will keep your mind off of other things that might be
bothering you. So? What do you think? Can I go back with you?!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Hmmm...
</dd><dd>[Crystal Mirror activates]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[magic sounds]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [groaning] What happened?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: It's all pretty weird at first, but try to roll with it. [to "Tennis Match"] Hi!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Are these?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Hands.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: And what happened to the rest of my hoo—
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Feet! Those are feet. Remember the whole thing where I said you need to lay low? Now would be a good time to play it cool.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Oh. Right. Heh. Play it cool. Heh-heh.
</dd><dd>[jaunty music]
</dd><dd>[students chattering]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: You did say I'd make a good distraction.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: Mirror, pick up this popcorn!
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: Mirror, I command thee, pick upeth this poppage of corn!
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: Ugh! Why won't this thing work anymore?
</dd><dd><b>Patron</b>: Like... we were gonna eat some of that.
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: Mirror, make these annoying people go away. Well, that <i>kinda</i> worked...
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Juniper Montage?!
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: Whoa!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: What in the blazes are you doin' here?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Were you invited to the <i>Daring Do</i> premiere? Ooh, that's exciting! No, crazy! No, concerning! No! Just <i>no!</i> No offense.
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: I wasn't invited to the premiere. My uncle Canter Zoom felt bad for firing me, so he pulled some strings and got me this job.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: You work here?
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: As little as possible.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Y'know, if you hadn't tried to sabotage the movie, you could be celebrating with us.
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: Ooh! This should be <i>my</i> night! I would have found a way to be in the film if <i>you</i> all had stayed out of it! I would have been Daring Do! Everyone would've loved me! <i>See?</i>
</dd><dd><b>The Equestria Girls</b>: [confused reactions]
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: Can't you see what's right under your noses? Ugh! I wish you'd all just go away and <i>leave me alone!</i>
</dd><dd>[magic sounds]
</dd><dd><b>The Equestria Girls</b>: [screaming]
</dd><dd>[sinister music]
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: Hmm. Looks like I may be finally getting the hang of this.
</dd><dd><b>Reflection Juniper Montage</b>: [giggles] Hi, me!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Six cell phones, all straight to voicemail.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I'm sure they're around. What's the worst that could have happened? [licking]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Magic is on the loose here now, and it does <i>not</i>
 work the same way it does back in Equestria. Any number of terrible
things could have happened. [exhales] And lately, I spend eighty percent
 of my time thinking about them. My friends are probably fine. I'm
overreacting. But maybe not. I can't tell anymore.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: This is the problem you wanted to
talk to Princess Twilight about, right? Because you can still talk it
over with me if you want.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Or you could just journal with Princess Twilight about it. Whatever works.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: It's just... I know my friends and I
have been given special powers for a reason, and I want to be ready for
whatever is gonna be thrown at us. I guess knowing that is making me
feel like I could never really relax and let my guard down, so I end up
obsessing about it and can't get out of my own head.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Hmm. That is a toughie. Guess my
advice would be to just trust things will work themselves out in the
end. If you spend too much time worrying about the bad things that <i>might</i> happen, you'll miss out on all the good things that <i>are</i> happening.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Heh. Like how Princess Twilight's student is teaching me a lesson right now.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Yup. Like that.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [laughs] Come on. Let's go take a look around the theater. I'm sure they're fine.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Uh... Any clue yet where we are or what just happened? Anyone?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Pinkie Pie's on the case!
</dd><dd>[fourth wall creaking]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Nope, no wall over here. Come out, come out,
 walls, wherever you are! I don't get this place! There's no walls in
here anywhere!
</dd><dd>[magic sounds]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Somehow, some way, that dang Juniper sucked us all inside of that mirror of hers.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Or into some kind of limbo behind it.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I think I might be freaking out a little bit.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You call <i>that</i> a freakout?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: It's sort of a deep-down-inside freakout. Ah!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: On the upside, there's popcorn in here! [crunch, crunch] Mmm, sticky...
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: How could this happen on the evening of my very first movie premiere? Of all the nights! Curse you, cruel fate!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Not our number-one problem right now, Rarity.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Mmm, true. But perhaps we can agree it's in the top five.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Is there really no way out of here?
</dd><dd>[pellets crashing]
</dd><dd><b>Equestria Girls</b>: Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! [etc.]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, my heavens! What's that?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Chocolate-covered almonds?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Dibs!

</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: It's Juniper Montage!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [surprised] No! [gasps, seriously] Who's that?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: She's trouble. Huh. That's Fluttershy's barrette. Wait here for me.
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: Sunset Shimmer. I was wondering if you'd show up.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I'm, uh, looking for my friends. I don't suppose you've seen them.
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: [giggles mischievously]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Where are they?
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: I'll never tell.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: You don't have to.
</dd><dd>[magic noises]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Canter Zoom</b>: You're lucky I offered to get you this job after the stunt you pulled on my set!
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: I just wanted to be Daring Do. I just wanted people to like me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: Everyone would love me if it weren't for you girls! This is all your fault! Ugh! I wish you'd all just go away and <i>leave me alone!</i>
</dd><dd><b>The Equestria Girls</b>: [scream]
</dd><dd>[magic noises]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: What?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I know you want people to like you. But trust me, the magic in that mirror is only gonna make things worse for you.
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: You're just saying that because you want the mirror for yourself.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: What I want is my friends back. Please, Juniper. You wished them into that mirror. Maybe there's a way you can wish them out.
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: Or maybe... I wish you'd join them!

</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Oh...
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hooray! We're all together again!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But wait. If we're all together, then nobody out there knows where we are!
</dd><dd>[flashing sounds]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, girls...
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Starlight Glimmer does!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, girls...
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: You mean Twilight's student back in Equestria?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: How would <i>she</i> know where— Ohhhh!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You didn't. She isn't...!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I kinda told her she could come back here with me.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Girls...
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: You really think Princess Twilight would be okay with that?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I don't know for sure that she <i>wouldn't</i> be okay with it.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, so sorry to interrupt, but—
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Whoa! Check out our geodes!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [sighs] That's what I was trying to say.
</dd><dd>[magic noises]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Something's changed. This wasn't happening before.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Maybe it's because all seven of us are together now.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Is this a good thing or a bad thing?
</dd><dd>[magic noises]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I'm going with not a good thing!

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Whoa! If Starlight Glimmer doesn't find a way to get us out of here soon, I don't know what's gonna happen!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Starlight Glimmer, I hope you know what you're doing.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: Give that back!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: No! This mirror is nothing but trouble. You have to realize that.
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: What I realize is that you are just like those other girls! I wish you'd join them!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Eh... Phew! Looks like you can't make that wish unless <i>you're</i> the one holding the mirror! Whoa!

<dl><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Is fame really what you're after or are you looking for something else?
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: Like what?!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Like... a friend?
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: Who would want to be <i>my</i> friend?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: <i>I</i> would.
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: Why?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Because I understand you, Juniper.
You think getting revenge is going to make you feel better, but it's
not! Please, don't make a mistake that you'll end up regretting for the
rest of your life.
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: I've already made too many mistakes. What I've done is... is... unforgivable.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: No, Juniper. I know they'll forgive you. But first, you have to set them free!

</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: So much for laying low.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I think even Princess Twilight would understand.
</dd><dd>[sad harp music]
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: I'm <i>so</i> sorry.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: It's okay. We've all been there.
</dd><dd><b>Juniper Montage</b>: Really?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Manipulated an entire town into giving up their talents so they wouldn't think they were special.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Overpowered by a magic I couldn't
control and created a rift between two worlds, almost destroying both of
 them in the process.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Turned an entire school into my own personal zombie army in hopes of conquering a distant pony world.
