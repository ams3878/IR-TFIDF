<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [rhythmically] To the right! To the right! To
 the left! To the left! Now up! Now up! Bring it down! Spin it around!
Wash that car like you mean it! Come on!
</dd><dd>[water rushing]
</dd><dd>[blow dryer whirring]
</dd><dd>[squeaking]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hah! Thanks, Big Mac.
</dd><dd>[car driving away]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Sweet! More cash to add to the stash!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Woo-hoo!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [sighs] How about a little break? All of this sunshine and suds are doing a number on my hair.
</dd><dd><b>All</b>: [agreeing]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hey, anybody seen Twilight lately?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm here. I was just going over the numbers again.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Have we raised enough to make all the repairs to Camp Everfree?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We've only raised half. I counted the money four times just to be sure.
</dd><dd><b>All</b>: [groan]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: It's all right. We can just wash more cars. There's gotta be some we missed.
</dd><dd>[wind blowing]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I, uh, think we're gonna have to come up with a new plan.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: But we're running out of time! The camp
fundraising deadline is next week. And Pinkie Pie's already hosted a
bake sale, Twilight and Fluttershy had that doggie day care, and Sunset
Shimmer and I planned this car wash.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Not to worry, darlings. It's my turn to devise a
 plan, and I already have something amazing in mind. It will be the most
 profitable of all of our fundraising events! The <i>pièce de résistance</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hee-yoo! Now we're talkin'! What's your idea?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Meet me in the music room later this afternoon, and I will explain everything.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh-huh!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hee-hee!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: You got nothin', huh?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: How did you know?!
</dd></dl>

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, rats. Three hours and still no ideas for a lucrative last-minute fundraiser. Usually, window-shopping inspires me.
</dd><dd><b>TV announcer</b>: Are you a musician?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Hmm?
</dd><dd><b>TV announcer</b>: Do you and friends love to dance?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Yes.
</dd><dd><b>TV announcer</b>: Are you unique, cool, stylish?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Yes, yes, yes, and... obviously!
</dd><dd><b>TV announcer</b>: Do you want to win a <i>cash prize</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Yes!
</dd><dd><b>TV announcer</b>: Then enter the Canterlot Mall Chance to
Prance Competition! All you need is a music video of your own original
song and dance. Then <i>you</i> could be prancing your way to first prize! Sign up now at the booth near the Aunt Orange smoothie kiosk.
</dd><dd>[screech]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, we're certain to win!
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: [sweetly] Rarity! What a nice surprise! [sourly] Not.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [gasps] Sour Sweet! Sunny Flare! Why, it's been ages.
</dd><dd><b>Sugarcoat</b>: It's only been a few months since the Friendship Games.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Is that all? Wow! [giggles] How is everything over at Crystal Prep Academy?
</dd><dd><b>Sunny Flare</b>: Oh, things at CPA have never been better since Principal Cadance took over.
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: Yeah. She's going to let us have the spring dance on a yacht, if we raise the money.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Ooh, sounds divine.
</dd><dd><b>Lemon Zest</b>: Are you signing up for the "Chance to Prance" contest, too?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I am! Heh-heh. Are you girls here to sign up for the competition?
</dd><dd><b>Sugarcoat</b>: We definitely aren't here because we like standing in lines.
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: I assume you already have a video concept figured out. The competition's going to be pret-ty fierce.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Yes, it came to me as soon as I saw that gorgeous red ruffled <i>ensemble</i> on the way over here.
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: Oh. Tell me more.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh! Well, each member of the Rainbooms is going
to dance in a different style—like flamenco, hip-hop, or street
ballet—and we'll wear costumes to match each genre. Designed by yours
truly, of course. [giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Sugarcoat</b>: That sounds like a very good concept.
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: Yeah, heh, I guess it's okay. If you're going for way too over-the-top.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Thanks! So, what's your concept?
</dd><dd><b>Sugarcoat</b>: Nothing. We don't have one yet.
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: What she means is it's a surprise! But it's a-ma-zing. So original.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, well, I can't wait to see it. Good luck!
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: You, too!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: See? It's a wonderful plan. We'll write some
lyrics for our new song, and we'll choreograph some dance moves. Then
our video will win a cash prize, and <i>voilà</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: You make it sound simple as pie.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: That's because it is! The girls at Crystal Prep even agree. They're making a video, too.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: They are?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I-Is that a problem, darling?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, no, it's not. Just haven't heard much about my old school since I left, I guess.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Well, if you ask me, Crystal Prep has got nothin' on CHS! I love it here! [shudders] See what I mean?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Okay, before we get started with the
choreographing of our dance moves and [mumbling], there's just one tiny,
 teeny-weensey, little thing I forgot to mention.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: What's that?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Uhhhh... [quickly] I would need to use our fundraiser money to buy costume materials for the video!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Hmm. How much is the grand prize worth?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: More than double what we need to fix up Camp Everfree!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hah! Then of course you can use the money for costumes!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [sighs] Oh, what the hay? Why not?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Sweet!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Whee-hee!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: According to my calculations, if we
lend Rarity the funds we've already raised, we stand to gain four times
as much money as we have now.
</dd><dd><b>The Equestria Girls</b>: [cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But if we lose the video contest,
we'll be completely back to square one and zero dollars. Anyone else
think this is an awfully risky endeavor? I mean, um, heh... Me neither.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: All right, girls. Who's ready to shoot our winning dance music video?
</dd><dd><b>The Equestria Girls</b>: [cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [laughs] Looks like I have some fabric shopping to do!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Let's take it from the top one more time. Rainbow
 Dash, don't forget your cue. It's when Fluttershy does her triple
pirouette, okay?
</dd><dd>[beep]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: And... action!
</dd><dd>["Dance Magic" instrumental playing]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b> and <b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [grunting]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Cut!
</dd><dd>[record scratch]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hey! What happened to the music?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Fluttershy, it's supposed to be a <i>triple</i> pirouette.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [yawns]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I know. It's just that... um... uh, I-I don't think I can do one of those.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Darling, of course you can, darling. I believe in you.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: How about you try "jazz paws" instead?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Heh. Thanks, Spike. But all these moves are pretty hard.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, I know. But if we want to win, we have to bring our A-game!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Crystal Prep certainly will. They're excellent dancers, and you know how they love to compete.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: How about we forget about the other teams and get back to dancin'?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Great idea, Applejack! [imitating synth
drums] It's really fun! [imitating synth drums] I haven't stopped this
whole time! [pants]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Let's take it from Rainbow's entrance. [sighs] And... action!
</dd><dd>["Dance Magic" instrumental playing]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [grunting]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Whoa!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh! Oh! This is a disaster!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Whoops. Sorry, Rarity.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh. Well, I <i>can</i> fix it, but I'll have to run to the fabric store before it closes. Keep practicing while I'm gone! Ahhh!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, thank goodness I budgeted for backup fabric.
</dd><dd>[dance music]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [gasps] Is that a disco-inspired look? And a street ballet tutu?! I don't believe it. They stole my brilliant idea!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[sewing machine whirring]
</dd><dd>[knock, knock, knock]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: We're here!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We got your text. You said it was an emergency?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Everythin' all right, sugarcube?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, since you asked... [sobbing] the answer is <i>no!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, no! What happened?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [through tears] Sour Sweet... and the...
Crystal... Prep girls stole our video concept! [sniffs] I saw them
filming at the mall. They copied my design ideas and everything! So of
course they looked absolutely fabulous. But the worst part is that
they're all incredible dancers!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] Major bummer in the summer! Tissue for your issue?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [sniffs] Ta. [blows nose] Everyone is counting
on me, on the video to win us the prize money for the camp. [sighs] Oh,
how could I have been such a fool?! Of course, those Crystal Preppers
stole my concept! I practically served it to them on a platter!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Don't be too hard on yourself. It's
gonna take more than one Friendship Games for those Crystal Prep girls
to learn that winning isn't everything.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Eh, maybe this was all for the best.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Hmm? W-What do you mean?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh, your concept and costumes are really awesome, but, uh... our dancin'...
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Nnnnot so much.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [giggles] We could barely get in a two-step without trippin' over each other's boots. [laughs]
</dd><dd><b>The Equestria Girls</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You can say that again!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Nonsense! You all looked great! [sighs] Okay,
maybe not great, but, but... but it was getting there! And the point is
we don't have to <i>let</i> them win! That is <i>our</i> video concept!
And I am going straight to Crystal Prep to let them know that they have
messed with the wrong girls! Mmm! Who's with me?!
</dd><dd>[silence]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [clears throat] No, n-no, seriously, who <i>is</i> with me? I have no idea how to get to Crystal Prep.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'll go. Maybe I can try to reason with them. We <i>were</i> classmates once.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: That's the spirit! Come on!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[spy music]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Okay, where's the dance studio?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: There's a dance studio?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Didn't you go to this school?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, I can show you where the library is.
</dd><dd>[dance music]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Wait, shhh. That's their music. Bingo!
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: Hey, girls! So what did you think of our routine? Scared yet?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Don't change the subject, Sour Sweet!
</dd><dd><b>Sugarcoat</b>: But you didn't bring up a subject.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: You, either!
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: Ooookay...
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: You know why we're here! You stole my— <i>our</i> music video idea! Now... change your concept, or else!
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: Sorry, heh, but we can't.
</dd><dd><b>Shadowbolts</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And why is that?
</dd><dd><b>Sunny Flare</b>: Because we care about winning. Duh!
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: And we will, because we're just about to submit our video.
</dd><dd><b>Shadowbolts</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: You're what? [stammers] It doesn't matter! Because we are still doing our video the way we planned!
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: Go ahead. But there's just one flaw in your little plan.
</dd><dd><b>Sunny Flare</b>: By the time you submit yours, it'll just look like <i>you</i> copied <i>us</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Sugarcoat</b>: Except the worse version.
</dd><dd>[dance music resumes]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, this is all my fault! All the money we raised
 is gone, and now we have no music video! I should never have convinced
you all that we could pull this off in so little time!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Are you crazy? We're great at doing stuff
super-fast. I mean, look at Pinkie Pie. She just built that castle made
entirely out of chocolate bars while we were talking.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [chomps, gulps] Want some?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: What <i>I</i> want is a new video concept!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Eh. [chomps]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: So let's create one!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Really?
</dd><dd><b>The Equestria Girls</b>: [agreeing]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I'm sure if we all put our heads together, we'll come up with something even <i>better</i> than before.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Okay. I suppose it's worth a try.
</dd><dd>[zip]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I think it's working!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Yeah! I-I got somethin'! Okay, so we're in home-ec class...
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Aah!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: ...bakin' some apple fritters! And then, a
fresh batch comes outta the oven. [sniffs, sighs] And everybody's havin'
 a great time!
</dd><dd><b>The Equestria Girls</b>: [conversing]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Wait. So basically, we are eating pastries at school in our music video?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [laughs] Uh, I guess I'm just kinda hungry.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Anyone have another idea?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh, oh! I do! So... we're in the middle of
 the jungle. And we're being chased by henchmen who are shooting poison
arrows at us!
</dd><dd><b>The Equestria Girls</b>: [screaming]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: When suddenly, out of nowhere, the shadow of a giant beast appears!
</dd><dd>[Ahuizotl roars]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Wait a second! Isn't this a scene from the latest Daring Do book?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [laughs] Oh, yeah. <i>That's</i> why it seemed so cool. Never mind.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Okay! I've got it!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [screams] Please, do tell.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: We'll start out on... the moon! And we'll be
 wearing really sparkly costumes. No, wait! We'll be in spacesuits!
We're surrounded by gorgonzola cheese! But then, a space doggie walks
over and start to eat the cheese!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Mmm! Rich with buttery undertones.
</dd><dd><b>The Equestria Girls except Rarity</b>: [giggling]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: <i>Stop! This will never work!</i> [frustrated noise]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Aw, why not?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [grumbles] Because the contest is for dance music videos, and not one of your ideas included dancing at all!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: But they were pretty funny, huh? [giggles] I liked yours, Rainbow Dash.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Thanks, Pinkie!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [growls]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Are you okay?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Okay? No, I am not okay! The contest deadline is tomorrow, and we have just been wasting time!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [crying and sobbing] Nom-nom-nom-nom-nom. [resumes crying] Nom-nom-nom-nom-nom.
</dd><dd><b>Sunny Flare</b>: It's no use, Sour Sweet. Why are we even still trying?
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: Because the deadline hasn't passed. We can <i>still</i> come up with an original song to replace the Sapphire Shores one we've been practicing our choreography with.
</dd><dd><b>Sugarcoat</b>: That's highly unlikely.
</dd><dd><b>Lemon Zest</b>: Why did we tell Rarity that we already submitted our video?
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: So that we can still use her concept. Rarity is creative. She'll come up with something else. But if <i>we</i> don't, we have nothing. And imagine what our classmates would say.
</dd><dd><b>Lemon Zest</b>: They'll say it's our fault the spring dance
had to be held in the boring old auditorium instead of on a yacht like
we promised.
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: Exactly.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh. They just don't want to disappoint their classmates.
</dd><dd><b>Sugarcoat</b>: But the Rainbooms <i>have</i> a band. They'll surely have a killer original song, and we don't.
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: Yet.
</dd><dd><b>Sunny Flare</b>: Face it, Sour. We're doomed.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [clears throat] Excuse me, girls.
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: R-Rarity! Uh, how long have you been over there?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Long enough to hear that you have no original song.
</dd><dd><b>Sugarcoat</b>: Like I said. Doomed. [sips]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [chuckles, clears throat] Maybe you're not.
Look, I know our teams haven't been getting along too well lately. But I
 think I have a solution where everybody wins.
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: We're listening.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: So what's the big plan you were excited about?
</dd><dd><b>The Equestria Girls</b>: [gasp, awed reactions]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Aren't the Crystal Prep girls using this video idea now?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: They are, yes. But so are we! Girls, you can
come out now! I know it's hard to believe, but the Crystal Preppers here
 helped me to realize that competing <i>against</i> one another was getting us nowhere.
</dd><dd><b>Lemon Zest</b>: And Rarity helped show us that winning was the only thing driving us. We didn't even care if we had to steal to accomplish it.
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: But that's not who we are. Anymore.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: The Crystal Prep Academy girls have offered to help with dance moves if we'll help them with an original song.
</dd><dd><b>Sugarcoat</b>: Combining our talents is the most logical thing to do.
</dd><dd><b>Sunny Flare</b>: We'll make one epic music video together.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity:</b> So, what do you guys think? Are you in?
</dd><dd><b>The Equestria Girls</b>: Ummmmm...
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Best! Music! Video! Idea ever!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>All</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: We can start by teaching you the words to our song.
</dd><dd><b>Sunny Flare</b>: But this is just about the Rainbooms. There's nothing about us in the lyrics.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Yet. Wanna help me make some changes?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Anybody else care to work on some music?
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: We'll get to it after I teach you some dance moves.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Music first.
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: Dance first.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Music first!
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: Dance first!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: <i>Music first!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: <i>Dance first!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Sugarcoat</b>: The order is irrelevant.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, yeah.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b> and <b>Sour Sweet</b>: [laughing]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Lights!
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: Camera!

most brilliant idea! Maybe Crystal Prep could use an award-winning band
to play at their spring dance? It'll be the perfect way to show off your
 new dance moves!
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: That would be amazing! Of course, then we'd have a new dilemma to deal with.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, no. What?
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: Figuring out what we're all gonna wear?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, I already have some ideas that I'd be willing to share.
