<dl><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: La, la la, la la, la la, la la. Thank you
little squirrel, but remember: these flowers are for Princess Celestia.
Only the prettiest ones will do. La, la la, la la, la la, la la.

</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Gah!
</dd><dd><b>Parasprite</b>: [chirp]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Hello, little guy. I've never seen anything like you before.
</dd><dd><b>Parasprite</b>: [sniff]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, are you hungry? Here you go. [gasp] I guess you <i>were</i> hungry.
</dd><dd><b>Parasprite</b>: [purr]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: You're the cutest thing <i>ever</i>! I can't wait to show you to my friends.

<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh! Hurry up, Spike! This place isn't gonna clean itself.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: It also didn't mess itself up.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Princess Celestia will be here tomorrow!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I thought this was just an unofficial <i>casual</i> visit.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: There's nothing casual about a visit
from royalty. I want this place to be spotless, and you've barely made a
 dent in the clutter.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Maybe you should, ugh, start reading them one at a time-- whoa ho! Aw.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Everything's got to be perfect. No time for fooling around.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: You know, this would be an awful lot easier if there weren't two of us here getting under each other's feet.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Great idea. You clean, I'll go see how everyone else's preparations are coming.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Or maybe I should... [groan]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[ponies chatter]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What happened to the rest of her name?
</dd><dd><b>Golden Harvest</b>: We couldn't fit it all in.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You can't hang a banner that says "Welcome Princess <i>Celest</i>". Take it down and try again.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>That</i> looks perfect. Keep up the good work.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. How's the banquet coming?
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: Uh...it would be coming a little better if...
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Mmm... [slurp]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Pinkie</i>! What are you doing? Those sweets are supposed to be for the princess.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I know. That's why I'm tasting them.
Somepony needs to make sure that everything is tasty enough to touch the
 royal tongue, and I, Pinkie Pie, declare that these treats are fit for a
 <i>king</i>, or a <i>queen</i>, or a <i>princess</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Twilight, Pinkie, you won't believe... oh, I'm sorry. Uh, am I interrupting?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No, not at all. Come on in and make yourself at home. [slurp] What's going on, Fluttershy?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: You won't believe what I found at the edge of the Everfree Forest. Come on out, little guy. It's okay.
</dd><dd><b>Parasprite</b>: [purr] [chirp]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [gasp] Three?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: They're <i>amazing</i>. What are they?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I'm not sure. I'm also not sure where these other two came from.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'll take one off your hooves. I've never seen anything so... <i>adorable</i>. Besides, it'll be nice to have a companion for Spike so he won't bother me so much while I'm studying.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Pinkie, do you want the other one?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ugh! A parasprite? <i>Are you kidding</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: <i>Ugh</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: A para-<i>what</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: How could you not like...
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ugh. Now I gotta go find a <i>trombone</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: A <i>what</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: A trombone, you know: [trombone imitation]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ahhh, typical Pinkie.
</dd><dd><b>Parasprite</b>: [purr]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Stand still, Rainbow Dash.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ugh, I <i>caaan't</i>, I need to <i>flyyy</i>! This is waaay too boring for me.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: <i>Do</i> you want to look nice for Princess Celestia or not?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Wow. Rarity, those outfits are gorgeous.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Mmhmm. Thank you, Twilight. Nice to know <i>someone</i> appreciates my talents.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ugh, <i>sooo boooring</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Parasprites</b>: [chirp]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Huh?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What's that sound, Twilight?
</dd><dd><b>Parasprite</b>: [several chirps]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Wow, what are they?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The better question is, where did they come from? I only had one a minute ago.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, I'll take one.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Me too, oh, they're perfect.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Does anypony know where I can find an accordion?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>, <b>Rainbow Dash</b>, and <b>Rarity</b>: [baby noises]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Girls! <i>Hello</i>! This is important. Durgh! Thanks a lot.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sigh] The decorations, the banquet, I really hope everything comes together in time for tomorrow.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [snore]
</dd><dd><b>Parasprite</b>: [baby noises]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, [yawn] what's there to worry about?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Parasprites</b>: [loud baby noises]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike! Wake up! What happened?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Huh? Whaaa! What's going on?
</dd><dd><b>Parasprite</b>: [chirp]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Where did they come from?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I don't know. The little guy got hungry in the
night, so I gave him a snack, but... I have no idea where these others
came from. Oh no! They're messing up all my hard work!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The princess will be here in a few hours.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Ugh.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike, help me round up these little guys.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Ugh, what does it look like I'm doin'? Ooow, waaah! D'oh. I know, I know, "stop fooling around".
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Parasprite</b>: [several chirps]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Huh? Huh?! [screech] [grunt] [groan] Get off me! [groan] [grunt] Waaa!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Not only are you adorable, but you're also quite useful.
</dd><dd><b>Parasprite</b>: [purr] [grunt]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh! Are you okay? Aaah! [gasp] <i>Eewww</i>. Aaah! Gross gross <i>gross</i>! No creature that behaves so revoltingly is allowed in my boutique!
</dd><dd><b>Parasprite</b>: [grunt] [pop]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [screech]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Look Rarity, Applejack loaned me a harmonica. [plays harmonica] Isn't that great?
</dd><dd><b>Parasprites</b>: [chirping]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasp] And not a moment too soon.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Ugh, Pinkie, I'm a little busy right now.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: And I'm <i>not</i>? You know how many more instruments I've gotta find? <i>A lot</i>, that's how many. Now if we split the list between us, we might just make it in time.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: <i>Please</i>, Pinkie, I don't have time for some silly scavenger hunt. I've got a <i>real</i> problem.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You've got a real problem, all right. And a banjo is the only answer!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasp]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [gasp] I see we're having the same problem.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ditto!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Fluttershy knows <i>everything</i> about animals, I'm sure she can tell us how to stop them from multiplying.
</dd><dd><b>Parasprites</b>: [chirp]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: ...or not.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ugh, do something Fluttershy, can't you control them?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I've tried everything I know: I've tried begging, and pleading, and beseeching, and asking politely and...
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Guh.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [whine]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: [scream]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: If we can't get them under control before the princess arrives, it'll be a total disaster.
</dd><dd><b>Parasprite</b>: [hack]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Ew! If you ask me, it's already a total disaster.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Here's all those apples you wanted, Fluttershy, but I still can't figure why y'need so many. Hey!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: What do we do?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasp] I got it! Nopony can herd like Applejack.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah! We can drive 'em back into the forest.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [scoffs] I'll rastle 'em up, but I need
everypony's help to do it. Twilight, you and Rarity wait over there.
I'll herd the little critters straight at ya like a funnel. Rainbow
Dash, you and Fluttershy stay on top of 'em, don't let 'em fly away.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Aye aye.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Yeeeeeee-haw!
</dd><dd><b>Parasprite</b>: [screech]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Alright y'all, here goes nothin'. Look out
Rarity, that one's fixin' to get away. Keep a lead on 'em, Rainbow Dash!
 Hold on girls, we're almost there.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Twilight, we don't have much time.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You're telling me. The princess could arrive at any moment.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Exactly. That's why I need you gals to drop what you're doing and help me find some <i>maracas</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Maracas? Pinkie, we've got much bigger problems than missing <i>maracas</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasp] You're right! Getting a tuba has to be our number one goal. Follow me. I said, follow me!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Pinkie Pie, you are so <i>random</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: And you are all so stubborn!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Forget her ladies. Focus. Head 'em up and move 'em out.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: All <i>right</i>! [grunt]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Ouch.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We did it. Nice work, Applejack.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Couldn't a'done it without y'all.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Now let's get back and clean up the mess they made before the princess arrives.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Okay, everyone knows what to do, right? We gotta work extra hard to make up for lost time.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Where did they come from?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Well, I may have kept just one. Heh. I couldn't help myself. They're just so cute.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We don't have time to keep rounding up these things. What do we do now?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: We call in the weather patrol. [grunts]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [shriek]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Time to take out the adorable trash. YAAAAAA!
</dd><dd><b>Parasprites</b>: [chirp]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [grunt] Way to go, Rainbow Dash!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Looks like our problems are solved.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: They will be with these cymbals. [crash] Hey! Give me those back!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Whoa. Yaa! Yow! Whoa! Wow! I can't hold it! She's breaking up.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie Pie, what have you done?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I've lost a brand new pair of cymbals, that's what I've done.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Will you forget about your silly instruments for one second? You're ruining our efforts to save Ponyville.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Me? Ruin? I'm not the ruiner, I'm the ruin-<i>ee</i>! Or is it ruiness? Ruinette?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Come on girls, there's no reasoning with that one. She's a few apples short of a bushel.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hey! I'm trying to tell you all that the ruining is on the other hoof. If you'd just slow down and <i>listen to me</i>!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Parasprites</b>: [chirps] [munch] [munch]
</dd><dd><b>Pony</b>: [gasp]
</dd><dd><b>Gardening pony</b>: Aah!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: What do we do? They're eating all the food in town.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [gasp] My apples!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We've gotta do something. [gasps] I got it! I'll cast a spell to make them stop eating all the food.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Look, tambourines! If you could all just... [scream] [tambourines shake]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasp]
</dd><dd><b>Parasprite</b>: [chirp]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sigh]
</dd><dd><b>Parasprite</b>: [munch]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Heh. Hey, it worked. They're not eating the <i>food</i> anymore.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh no... if they get inside my store... <i>Everypony for herself</i>!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: My outfits! Go on, shoo! Get out of here, you naughty! Naughty! [shrieks]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>I'll save you</i>!
</dd><dd>[recorder]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [shriek]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: No woodland creature's gonna eat the Apple Family's crop.
</dd><dd>[parasprites buzzing]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Brace yourself, y'all, here they come. [gasp] Didn't see that one comin'.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: Help!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasp] They're eating the <i>words</i>. [grunts]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Help...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Zecora</b>: Ugh. Have you gone mad?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Zecora, these little guys are devouring Ponyville, and the princess is on her way. Can you help us, please?
</dd><dd><b>Zecora</b>: Oh, monster of so little size. Is that a parasprite before my eyes?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I don't know! Is it?
</dd><dd><b>Zecora</b>: Tales of crops and harvests consumed. If these creatures are in Ponyville, you're doomed.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gulp]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [grunts] Oh no, here she comes.
</dd><dd>[ponies scream]
</dd><dd><b>Daisy</b>: Aaaah, aaaaaaah!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Okay, here's the plan. Rainbow Dash, you distract them.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: YAAAA!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Good. Everyone else, we need to build an exact copy of Ponyville right over there. <i>We've got less than a minute</i>. Zecora was right, we're doomed. Oh no, the princess's procession is here. It's all over!
</dd><dd>[polka music]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie? We're in the middle of a crisis here. This is no time for your... nonsense?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Look.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Twilight Sparkle, my prized pupil.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hello, princess.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: So lovely to see you again, as well as your friends.
</dd><dd>[crash]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: So... how was the trip? Hit much traffic?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Ah, what is this? Oh ho ho, these creatures are adorable.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: They're not <i>that</i> adorable.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: I'm terribly honored that you and the good citizens of Ponyville have organized a parade in honor of my visit.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Parade? Oh. Yes, the parade.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Unfortunately, that visit is going to
 have to wait for another time. I'm afraid an emergency has come up in
Fillydelphia. Apparently there's been some sort of <i>infestation</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: An... infestation?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Yes, a swarm of incredibly bothersome
 creatures has invaded the poor town. I'm sorry Twilight, to have to put
 you all through so much trouble.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Trouble? What trouble?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Before I have to go, would you care to give me your latest report on the magic of friendship in person?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: My... report?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Haven't you learned anything about friendship?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Actually, I have. <i>I've learned that
 sometimes the solution to your problems can come from where you least
expect it. It's a good idea to stop and listen to your friends' opinions
 and perspectives...</i>
</dd><dd>[cymbals crash]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Even when they don't always seem to make sense.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: I'm so proud of you, Twilight
Sparkle, and I'm very impressed with your friends as well. It sounds
like you're all learning so much from each other.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Thank you, princess.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hey, what happened to the princess?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Emergency in Fillydelphia.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Some sort of <i>infestation</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh no! Have they got parasprites too? Well, have tuba, will travel.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I think the princess can handle it.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: So you knew what those critters were all along, huh Pinkie Pie?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Well, duh! Why do you think I was so frantic to get my hooves on all these instruments? I <i>tried</i> to tell you.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We know, Pinkie Pie, and we're sorry we didn't listen.
</dd><dd>[<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'm sorry, Pinkie.] [<b>Rarity</b>: So sorry, Pinkie.] [<b>Fluttershy</b>: Sorry, Pinkie.] [<b>Applejack</b>: Real sorry, Pinkie.]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You're a great friend, even if we don't always understand you.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Thanks guys, you're all great friends too, even when <i>I</i> don't understand me.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You saved my reputation with Princess Celestia, and more importantly, you saved Ponyville.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: ...Or not.
