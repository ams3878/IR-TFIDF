</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Spring training was awesome, but I can't wait to see my friends!
</dd><dd>[locker door closes]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'm gonna catch up on some <i>Daring Do</i> with Twilight, help Applejack make my favorite cider, and have a sleepover with Pinkie!
</dd><dd><b>Misty Fly</b>: We get it. You have a fun week planned.
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: Meanwhile, I'm stuck here running trials week at the Academy.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: But you love yelling and blowing your whistle.
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: Yeah. I do.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: See you gals later!
</dd><dd>[whoosh]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [chuckles]
</dd><dd>[whoosh]

<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sighs]
</dd><dd>[cutie mark ringing]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Huh? Oh, the map!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hey, Twilight! So where am I going? The Crystal Mountains? Vanhoover? Here? Please say here.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, the good news is we both got called by the map!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Awesome! [beat] Does that mean there's bad news?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No. Well, not exactly.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [groans] I was just there!

<dl><dd>[whoosh]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ooh!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ahem.
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: All right, newbies! Welcome to trials week for
 the Wonderbolt Academy! You'll be judged on your speed, strength,
agility, and technique, culminating in a final evaluation. Will it be
hard? Yes! Will you cry? Maybe. Will you fly so much your wings fall
off? That has only happened once.
</dd><dd><b>Angel Wings</b>: She's just exaggerating to make a point, right? I mean, wings can't really fall off... can they?
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: You think you've got what it takes to be an elite flyer?
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: Yes, ma'am.
</dd><dd><b>Rest of recruits</b>: Yes, ma'am!
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: Well, lemme tell you. You don't!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sighs wistfully] I remember when she said that to me.
</dd><dd><b>Recruits</b>: [muttering in awe]
</dd><dd><b>Angel Wings</b>: You don't think Rainbow Dash is the pony whose wings fell off, do you?
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: [blows whistle] Quit your whispering and give me five hundred laps! Go, go, go!
</dd><dd>[whooshes]
</dd><dd><b>Angel Wings</b>: Um, I just wanted you to know, you two are my favorite ponies in all of Equestria.
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: Well, isn't that sweet? <i>Now get going on those laps!</i>
</dd><dd>[whoosh]
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: Welcome, Princess Twilight. [to Rainbow Dash] What are you doing back so soon?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Official friendship business.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Have you noticed anypony having a hard time with their friends?
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: Not really, but it's not my job to worry about their relationships. I'm here to make them elite flyers.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sighs] Adorable. They're so full of hope and competition. Eh, their technique could use some work, though.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You should tell them. I'm sure they'd appreciate any notes from you.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Nah. I wouldn't want to mess with their confidence.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But they'll never get better if they don't know what to work on.
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: Sloppy wing placement, crooked lines... I'm gonna have to drill them on basic technique in the classroom portion.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Classroom portion?
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: Yeah, it's everypony's least favorite part of trial week, but it has to be done.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Maybe we <i>can</i> help!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: We can?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Absolutely! Between <i>your</i> flying skills and <i>my</i>
 teaching expertise, they could learn a lot! Plus, once they get to know
 us, they'll be more comfortable coming to us with their friendship
problems!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Count us in!
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: Great! [blows whistle]
</dd><dd>[whooshes, thud]
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: You have your work cut out for you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Thank goodness I had time to whip up a
few charts on flight patterns and wing symmetry! It's fresh in my mind
from when I learned to fly! <i>This is so exciting!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Maybe for you. I practically fell asleep
when I went through this. Tell you what. I'll leave the teaching stuff
to you, and I'll just make sure they stay awake! [blows airhorn]
</dd><dd>[Twilight's ears ringing]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm pretty sure their thirst for knowledge will keep them bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [chuckles] Good one, Twilight.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [blows airhorn]
</dd><dd><b>Recruits</b>: [gasping]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Wake up, newbies! Class is in session!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hello, students! I'm Twilight Sparkle, and this is Rainbow Dash.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: But you can call us "T-Sparks" and "The Dashinator"!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [clears throat]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [laughs nervously] Just kidding.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And we're here to go over basic flying technique.
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: [groans]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Who said that?!
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: Me. I mean, we're here because we're amazingly awesome crazy-good flyers. We're <i>way</i> past basics.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What's your name?
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: Sky Stinger. You've, uh, never heard of me?
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: He set the record for the fastest vertical acceleration rate! Five hundred feet in two seconds!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [unimpressed] Huh. That's pretty impressive.
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: It's amazing.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [clears throat] It <i>is</i>, and we can talk personal records after class, Ms...?
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: Vapor Trail. She's my wingpony. I never fly without her.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: But you'll have to in the solo trials.
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: There are... [gulps] ...solo trials?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yup. It's a part of your final evaluation.
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: [scoffs] We'll ace that test with our wings tied behind our flanks. My picture will go right up there, next to yours.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That's a mighty big claim, considering everypony here is an amazingly awesome crazy-good flyer.
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: I know.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [clears throat] Okay! Let's get back on track. Now, who can tell me the best wing angle to achieve minimal air resistance?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [snoring]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [blows airhorn]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [quickly] Wake up newbies! Class is in session!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Recruits</b>: [chattering]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, there were a few hiccups, but overall, that went pretty well.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [cricks neck, yawns] Yeah, nopony fell asleep. What? I'm not a student!
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: Hey, Teach!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Me or Twilight? Probably Twilight.
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: Um, uh, both. About the solo test. I'm actually kinda worried about it.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Aw, that's all right. We all have moments where we doubt ourselves.
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: No, no. I've absolutely zero doubts about myself. I'm a strong flyer. Like, really, really, <i>really</i> strong. This isn't about me. I'm worried for Vapor.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, well, that is very... kind of you?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Tell you what. It's almost time for your freestyle training. Why don't you grab her and show us what you got?
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: Yes! Prepare to be impressed!
</dd><dd>[whoosh]
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: By me.
</dd><dd>[whoosh]
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: Like I said, Vapor still needs work.
</dd><dd>[whoosh]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[whooshing]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, he may be full of himself, but I have to admit, Sky is an excellent flyer. He must have shot up two hundred feet!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: But did you see Vapor Trail? Her wing was under his. I think she gave him a boost.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I guess I didn't even notice Vapor. I was too busy watching Sky.
</dd><dd>[whooshing]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps] I think you're right! Vapor
just created a gust of wind that caught Sky's wing at a forty-five
degree angle, propelling him into a flipping loop! [beat] Somepony paid
attention in class!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Sky obviously has no idea he's not actually amazingly awesome.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And Vapor's so busy making her friend
look good, she's not focused on her own flying at all. [gasps] This must
 be our friendship problem! And there's only one thing to do!

<dl><dd>[distant whooshing]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You don't want to tell them?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Of course not! Flying is like thirty percent skill and seventy percent confidence! You can't mess with a flyer's confidence!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But you can't improve if you don't
think you have to! Besides, Vapor's keeping a pretty big secret from
Sky, and that could lead to trouble!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, but if we tell them that they've been holding each other back, that could be trouble too!
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: Ah, I nailed that flipping loop. I'm actually surprised you're still here. Thought I blew you away.
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: [out of breath] You were... great, Sky.
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: Come on, Vapor Trail! You're gonna have to
build up your endurance if you want a shot at the Academy! Wonderbolts
don't get winded! Angel Wings, you call that cloud-busting?! That cloud
barely knew you were there! I love my job.
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: We'll keep working, and who knows? One day, you might come close to being almost as good as me.
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: Oh, I don't think so. You were voted Stratusburg's most promising flyer! I was voted best sneeze. [sneezes]
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: You do have a really great sneeze.
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: Thanks, Sky, but I don't think I can sneeze my way into the Academy. [sighs] I'm pretty beat. I'm gonna hit the showers.
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: You <i>have</i> to help her.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Actually, she's not the one—
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Will do!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[locker opens]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hey, you did great. You're a really strong flyer.
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: Uh, me?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Vapor Trail, we know what you've been doing.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You've been doing <i>great</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [groans] You've been helping Sky!
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: Uh, I don't know what you're talking about! Sky doesn't need anypony's help. He's amazing.
</dd><dd>[poink poink]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sighs] Not without you. And it's gonna be
 pretty obvious during the solo trials when he can't get enough air to
do a flipping loop.
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: Oh, no! I can't let that happen! I mean, ah, uh... Aw, sugarcubes!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Why are you doing this for him?
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: [sighs] It started when we were kids. You have to understand...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: [narrating] ...Sky grew up with a lot of
siblings. It was tough. He was always trying to get his parents'
attention. Meanwhile, I was an only child who hated all the attention I
got from mine.
</dd><dd><b>"Twirly Whirly"</b>: Vapor Trail! Where are you? Do you need a snack? Do you wanna do homework?
</dd><dd><b>"Steer Straight"</b>: Or we can just spend some time together! All day is never enough!
</dd><dd><b>Young Vapor Trail</b>: [sighs]
</dd><dd><b>Young Sky Stinger</b>: Mom, Dad, I'm here! Look, look, look-look-look-look, hey! Mom, Dad, can you see?
</dd><dd>[wind blowing]
</dd><dd>[whooshing, baby crying]
</dd><dd><b>Young Sky Stinger</b>: [sighs]
</dd><dd><b>Young Vapor Trail</b>: Whoa, that was amazing!
</dd><dd>[whoosh]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: [narrating] Flying together gave us both
what we wanted! But I never told Sky how much I was helping him. It
started with a small boost here or a little gust of wind there, but I
didn't think my help could actually hurt his chances.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I understand. But now you're <i>both</i> in trouble!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You need to work on your tricks, and Sky needs to be able to fly without you or he won't make it.
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: Oh, but he has to! Flying with the Wonderbolts has been Sky's dream ever since he was a colt!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What about you?
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: I... I guess I haven't thought about it. I just want to be with my best friend.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Then we have to find a way to help both of you.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Starting with telling Sky the truth.
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: No, you can't! Sky will be crushed! And without his confidence, he won't fly as well!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sighs] Then I guess we'll give Dash's method a shot.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yes! Hah-hah! I love being right! Okay,
here's what we do. Sky needs to build his strength. Air drills, wing
lifts, all that boring methodical stuff.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Sounds like my cup of oats.
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: But how will we get him to do that? He doesn't think he needs practice.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: We'll just tell Sky that he should
practice with Twilight so you won't feel so self-conscious about getting
 special training from me.
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: With you? Really?! You'd do that for me?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hah. You say that like it's not gonna be a blast.

</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: Hey, can we switch now? I want to do tricks with Rainbow Dash!
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: You can't! I mean, uh, you're already so good at the fancy stuff!
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: Heh. And the basic stuff. [beat] You're right, I don't need to practice at all.
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: Um, maybe, Sky, you should...
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: I'm already the best and everypony's gonna know it when I'm asked to join the Academy tomorrow.
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: But not if you don't practice...!
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: Heh. I wouldn't be surprised if they asked me to become a Wonderbolt straight out of the trials. Boom, dream achieved.
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: [squealing] <i>Sky, you're not as good as you think you are!</i> [gasps]
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: What did you say?
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: [sighs] Sky, I want you to get in as much as anypony, and you're amazing, but...
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: But what?
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: I've been... helping you.
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: [scoffs] Puh-lease! I don't need <i>your</i> help! Watch! [straining]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Gyuh...
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: [panting] How can you do this to me? Did you <i>all</i> know? Oh, great. So everypony but me knows I'm a joke. Was this your plan the whole time? To embarrass me?
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: What? No! Don't you know me at all?
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: I guess not, since it took me this long to find out you're a terrible wingpony!
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: [gasps] I can't believe you!
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: <i>I</i> can't believe I was ever your friend!
</dd><dd>[whoosh]
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: Thanks a lot.

</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Do you think they're still mad?
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, they're still mad.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: This is all my fault. If we'd just done things your way, maybe we could have avoided this whole mess.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: No, it's <i>my</i> fault. It hit me when I was watching Sky train with you. He wasn't even trying!
</dd><dd>[Dizzitron whirring]
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh, no. He's lost his confidence.
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: Do you want to tell me why one of my most promising students is flying like a balloon with a hole in it?!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, it's a long story, but we'll fix it.
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: Yes, you will. [blows whistle]
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [groans] We really messed up, huh?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I have a plan.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: [straining]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hey, Sky. I thought I might find you here.
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: Well, apparently, I need a lot of practice. Guess I'm not the natural I thought I was.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No, you're not.
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: [sarcastic] Thanks. Good pep talk.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I wasn't a natural at friendship. But
with some practice and help from my friends, I got better, and now I'm
the Princess of Friendship!
</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: So you're saying I can be the... Princess of Flying?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[whoosh]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You know, you're really good. You're lead pony material.
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: Hm. That's sweet of you, but no. I couldn't handle all the attention.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: But you'll never become a Wonderbolt if you're too afraid to shine. That <i>is</i> what you want, right?
</dd><dd><b>Vapor Trail</b>: Well, not at first. I just wanted to be with Sky. But learning to do all those fun tricks with you? It made me realize this <i>is</i> something I want for myself!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I was hoping you'd say that. Come with me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: What's <i>she</i> doing here?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Sky, Vapor was never trying to steal your spotlight. She thought she was helping you.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And Vapor, you shouldn't have been so content to take a back seat.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Now, you can either stay mad, or help each
 other and become two of the greatest flyers the Wonderbolt Academy has
ever seen! [beat] Please pick the second option. I don't want Spitfire
to be mad at me.
</dd><dd>[whoosh]

</dd><dd><b>Sky Stinger</b>: You were great! Even though you can out-fly me, you can be my wingpony anytime.
