</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Spike?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Mm-hmm...
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, there you are! I was starting to think you
weren't here. I realize this is last-minute, but I've decided on a quick
 trip to the gem cave! I am on an urgent mission to find some faceted
iridescence for my new design, and I can't think of anypony I'd rather
have along than my favorite basket holder/bodyguard Spike.

</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [echoing] <i>SPIKE!</i>
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: What? Oh. Hey, Rarity.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Honestly, Spike. It's almost as if you haven't been listening.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [blows fire] Oh, uh... of course I was. But just to be sure, could you say it all again?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [sighs] I was saying that I had planned on visiting the gem cave—
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh, no! Is that the time?!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Aah!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [panting]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Of course, you're right. This is a bit of a late start, and those gems won't pick themselves.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Uh-huh.
</dd><dd>[doors open]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: But the real question is which basket do you want to hold? The smaller one, right? [laughs]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh, right. Sorry, Rarity. Can I take a rain check on... What was that again?
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: The... gem cave?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Right. Sounds great. But I need to get to the post office before noon.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [laughs] All right, very funny. Obviously, you'll get the bigger basket, and I shall—

</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I don't understand. For as long as we've known
each other, Spike has never turned down an opportunity to join me here.
It's his favorite place.
</dd><dd>[gem clinking]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Ideally you catch the gems, dear. And for a trip to the post office of all places?
</dd><dd>[gem clinking]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Maybe you should move closer? And why would
Spike need to go to the post office at all? He sends mail by breathing!
Breathing, darling! Breath mail!

</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Honestly, Applejack, if you're going to fill in, you could make an attempt to hold the basket the way Spike would.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [spits] And how's that?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, for one thing, Spike knows how to keep things quiet so as not to waken the bats.
</dd><dd>[bats squeaking]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: <i>And</i> he usually pulls me closely so no gem ever touches the ground!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [gasps] Rarity, Spike's been followin' you closely since he got to Ponyville. And in case you hadn't noticed... [echoing] <i>I AIN'T SPIKE!</i>

</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Ugh! Besides my mane? Well, that is a question for Spike.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh. Well, Spike isn't here. I think he's at the post office.
</dd><dd>[scraping sounds]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Again?! What is it with Spike and the post office?!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Rarity, what's going on?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Spike declined my invitation to the gem cave, and I intend to find out why.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hmm. That doesn't sound like Spike. Did you two have some sort of fight?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: A fight? Goodness, Twilight. What in Equestria would we fight about?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I've had arguments with friends before, and they can put a real strain on friendships.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, certainly. But I think I'd remember if we had an argument.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Maybe you didn't realize it? Do you think you could've done something that unintentionally hurt his feelings?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, if I didn't realize what I did, how would I
 know what I have done when I did it? [brays] I wonder if that's it. It
certainly would explain his behavior. I must apologize!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: For what?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, pfft. That's hardly the point. Poor Spikey-Wikey! This calls for a grand gesture!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Okay. Good talk. [groans]

</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I'm not mailing it.
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: Then why are you pushing it into the post office?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh. I didn't realize griffons worked at the Ponyville Post Office.
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: Oh! [giggles] No, I don't work here exactly. I'm the official mail carrier of Griffonstone. Gabby Griffon. Nice to meet ya!
</dd><dd>[rattling]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [sighs] Yes, well, uh, these things aren't for sending. They're for apologizing to Spike.
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: Oh! Spike was just here. He went to go make us a—
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: That's perfect! It'll give me a chance to practice. Uh, you stand there and tell me if I hit the right apologetic notes.
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: What are you apologizing for?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Darling, I don't see why that matters.

</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [overdramatically] And that is why I simply
cannot bear the thought of having hurt you! And even though I don't know
 what it is that I did, I want you to know that it doesn't matter!
Because I am prepared to do anything to make it right! [sobs] And scene.
</dd><dd>[ka-chunk!]
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: [muffled speech]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, sorry, dear. Here.
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: I said, that sure sounds genuine.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, of course it sounds genuine! It <i>is</i> genuine!
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Rarity? What are you doing?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Obviously, I'm working on my apology to you, Spike. I don't know how I could be more genuine. I mean— [gasps] Spike!

don't know what I did or why you're mad at me! Just please say you
forgive me! [wailing] Pleeeeeeeease!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Of course I forgive you. But, uh, what are you apologizing for?
</dd><dd>[ka-chunk!]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Why does everypony keep harping on that—?! Wait. Don't <i>you</i> know?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: No, I'm not mad at you about anything.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: B-But... But I don't understand. If you're not upset with me, why in Equestria would you refuse to go to the gem cave?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Uh, because I had other plans?
</dd><dd>[clattering]
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: With me!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [gasps]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I don't understand. You two know each other?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Gabby and I are sort of pen pals.
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: Yeah! There was this whole thing where I
pretended to get a cutie mark because griffons don't get cutie marks, so
 Princess Twilight had Spike send a bunch of letters off to Griffonstone
 about the first griffon ever to get a cutie mark! Which I didn't really
 have.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Gabby wrote back explaining things, and after that we just started writing back and forth.
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: Turns out we have a lot in common! We both come from cultures that don't have the friendliest of reputations.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [slurps] And we're both in the message-sending business!
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: Uh-huh!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b> and <b>Gabby</b>: [chomp, gulp]
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: I sure wish I could send scrolls with my breath!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b> and <b>Gabby</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [forced laugh] Yes... Now I understand why you
didn't come to the gem cave. Having a friend in town is a rare treat.
Well, since you're busy today, maybe we can do something tomorrow.
Fabric shopping? I know how you love to pick out the colors.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Uh, actually, now that there's a griffon at Twilight's school, Gabby's here all the time.
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: Grampa Gruff asks for a lot of updates about how Gallus is doing. [sighs] Speaking of which, I better get going.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I'll fly with you.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, all right. You two fly along. I'm sure Spike and I can do something some other—

</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: ...time?

<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I cannot decide which shade of purple is the most royal! And there's the pink! How will I ever choose?!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [grunting] Too bad Spike's not here. I bet he could help you narrow it down.

closer, dear? I suppose now that Spike's always so busy with Gabby, I'm
just now realizing how much his presence has meant to me over the years.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Even closer, darling. I don't want to prick you. I have to admit everything feels a bit "less than" without him. Too close!
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, darling, it's no use. Thank you for trying. I'm just accustomed to the help of a small, highly attentive dragon.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Maybe you should let Spike know how grateful you are for everything he's done for you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: [snoring] Aah!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, I am sorry, Spike. I didn't mean to frighten you.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Rarity? What are you doing here?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, I realize it's late. Or rather, early. But
 I have a surprise, and I just couldn't wait to share it. The Great Gem
Crevasse of the Crystal Mountains!
</dd><dd>[click]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Whoa!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: It is only accessible once a year, and I thought
 a little day trip would make a wonderful thank you for all the help
you've given me over the years.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh. But I'm supposed to meet Gabby today for her rounds.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I see. Well, there's always next year.
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: You know what? I'll just write her a note.

</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: Hey, Spike!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Gabby! You won't believe where I went today!
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: Actually, I think I will. I got your scroll. The Great Gem Crevasse sounds a lot better than doing my rounds.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Mm-hmm!
</dd><dd>[gems clinking]
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: Whoa! It was definitely better! I gotta get back to Griffonstone, but you have to tell me all about the Crevasse tomorrow!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Absolutely! [grunts] Thanks again, Rarity. What a great day.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Gabby</b>: Okay! Start from the beginning, because I want to hear everything!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Well, to get to the Crevasse, you have to climb across a rope bridge because the air's too thin to fly!
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: That is amazing! Then what?!
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: Whoa!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Sorry, Rarity!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, no apology necessary, Spike. In fact, I was just looking for you.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: You were? Why?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Because I just acquired... these!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Passes to Power Ponypalooza!? For today!?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Mm-hmm! I know we just went to the Crevasse, but
 I feel I've barely scratched the surface of expressing my gratitude for
 all you do.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Uh... of course I want to go, but that'll be two days in a row we haven't hung out.
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: Nah! Are you kidding? It's Power Ponypalooza! You have to go! And now you'll have <i>two</i> things to tell me about!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Okay! Come on, Rarity! Let's go!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: Whew! Are my claws sore.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Indeed. I had no idea how much walking there is at a Power Pony convention!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [grunting] Aww. I know I told Gabby we'd hang out tomorrow, but I might need the whole day to rest.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Whoo. I know what you mean. Perhaps you could, uh, just send her another note.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b> and <b>Spike</b>: [grunting]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [chuckles] I think maybe you're right.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Honestly, I might need to spend tomorrow putting my hooves up as well. [laughs]

</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I hadn't counted on Power Ponypalooza being quite so draining, but I thought we might spend the day recuperating together.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: No way! <i>Ogres &amp; Oubliettes</i>?!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, I know how much you enjoy it. And this seemed like the perfect opportunity for you to teach me the game.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: [echoing] Spike? I got your note! I figured I'd come by before my rounds with a bowl of energizing turnip soup.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b> and <b>Spike</b>: [laughter fading in]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Can Princess Shmarity use her Shield of the Coiffure to defend herself from the purveyor of poor color coordination?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh, she can try... Success! Shmarity's shield holds against the Green-Eyed Monster's attack! And then—!
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: Spike?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh, hi, Gabby. We were just—
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: Your scroll said you were too tired to do anything today. But I guess you were just too tired to do anything with me.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: No-no-no-no! That's not true! I can come with you on your rounds right now!
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: I don't think so, Spike. Maybe I'll just handle the rounds on my own from now on.
</dd><dd>[thermos clinking]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oooh! Princess Shmarity uses her Prismatic Beam to change that poor monster's color to a more pleasing shade of purple!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: What do you think, Spike? Solids or prints?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [sighs] Prints, I guess. You already have a lot of solid colors.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, you are so right. Prints it is! So nice to have you back, Spike.
</dd><dd>[cash register rings]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Although I hope you're able to reconcile with Gabby.

<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I quite enjoyed our day together today, Spike.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Yeah...
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hi, Spike.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Uh-huh...
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hmmm. I've never seen Spike this sad before. Do you know what happened?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [clears throat] Yes, well, perhaps he's still just tired from Power Ponypalooza.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I don't think that's it.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I... suppose... it's possible it could have something to do with... [coughs] Gabby not wanting to spend time with him anymore.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What? I thought the two of them were hanging out all the time.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: They were! Honestly, it took everything I had to
 convince him to spend any time with me at all! But between crystal gem
crevasses, Power Pony conventions, and a marathon game of <i>O&amp;O</i>, I managed to get some time in.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It sounds like you made sure he didn't have any time to spend with Gabby at all.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: What?! Pfft! I most certainly did not!
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, I... suppose I may have monopolized him a
teeny bit. [sighs] I'd just grown so used to having Spikey-Wikey around,
 I wasn't prepared for how much I'd miss him when he wasn't.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Friendships change, but just because Spike made a new friend doesn't mean he stops being yours.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I know, but now I have to share him! Which I suppose I'll have to get used to. [gasps] Right after I fix the mess I've made!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Good talk.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Gabby</b>: [sighs]
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd>[music playing]
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: Rarity? Is all this stuff for Spike again? Wouldn't it be easier to just give it to him? And why are you even here?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I am here to apologize. Actually, more to confess. And all of this stuff isn't for Spike. It's the evidence against me!
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: Evidence? For what?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: For my acts of utter selfishness!
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: I don't understand.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: These are items I used to lure Spike into spending as much time with me as possible!
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: They are? You did?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Rarity? What are you doing?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, obviously I'm apologizing to Gabby so the
two of you can renew your friendship, Spike. Now please, even if you
can't forgive me, you simply must forgive— [gasps] Spike?! Oh. I
actually owe you an apology, too.
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: You apologize a lot.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I wish I didn't need to, but the more time you
two spent together, the more I missed my time with Spike, and the more I
 used every means at my disposal to get it back. I am truly sorry.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: You really miss spending time with me?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, of course!
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: I have to say, after not hanging out with you, I
understand why. You're kinda awesome! And I know what it's like to miss
that now, too.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: So, do you think maybe we could start hanging out again?
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: Absolutely.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I don't suppose you'd like some company on your rounds right now?
</dd><dd><b>Gabby</b>: I sure would!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Wonderful! I can't tell you how pleased I am that the two of you have— [laughs] ...reconciled.

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [panicked yelping, whispering] Sorry! I just didn't want to drop another one and wake the bats.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [whispering] Darling. Catching the gems is what the basket is for.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [whispering] Wow. You two need to be a lot quieter.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Spike! How wonderful to see you!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Yeah. Gabby and I had a great day, but I'll always still want my Rarity time.
