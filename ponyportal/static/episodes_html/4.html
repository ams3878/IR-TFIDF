<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Boy howdy! I got my work cut out for me. That there is the biggest bumper crop o' apples I ever laid eyes on.
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup. Too big for you to handle on your own.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Come on, big brother! You need to rest up and
 get yourself better. I haven't met an apple orchard yet that I can't
handle. Oops, sorry. I'll take a bite out of this job by day's end.
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Biting off more than you can chew is just what I'm afraid of.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Are you sayin' my mouth is makin' promises my legs can't keep?
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Why of all the... This is your sister Applejack, remember? <i>The loyalest of friends and the most dependable of ponies</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: But still only one pony, and one pony plus hundreds o' apple trees just doesn't add up to...
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Don't you use your fancy mathematics to muddy
 the issue! I said I could handle this harvest and I'm gonna prove it to
 you. I'm gonna get every last apple out of those trees this applebuck
season <i>all by myself</i>. [gulps]

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [laughter] Hey...! [vibrating] This makes my voice sound silly!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie Pie, are you crazy?! Run!
</dd><dd><b>Mayor Mare</b>: Everypony calm down. There is no need to panic.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: But Mayor, whatever shall we do?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Look there!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: YEEHAW!
</dd><dd>[ponies cheer]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Move aside, Winona. Put 'em up, girl!
</dd><dd><b>Winona</b>: [barking]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [moan]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: This is the best rodeo show I've ever seen. [eats popcorn]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Come on, little dogies! Turn! [whistle] Winona, put 'em up! Ha hah! Gotcha. [grunt]

</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: <i>Whoaaa</i>. Hooie. Now what was <i>that</i> all about?
</dd><dd><b>DaisyJo</b>: [moo] [cough] Oh my! Begging your pardon, Applejack, but Moo-riella here saw one of those nasty snakes.
</dd><dd>[cows startled]
</dd><dd><b>DaisyJo</b>: And it just gave us all the willies, don'tcha know.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I completely understand. Just next time, try and steer clear of Ponyville.
</dd><dd><b>DaisyJo</b>: We certainly will, Applejack. So long, Winona!
</dd><dd>[ponies cheer]
</dd><dd>[crowd: Applejack!]

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Apple<i>tastic</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Mayor Mare</b>: <i>Exactly</i>. We must do something to thank Applejack for single-hoofedly saving the town.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I know.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: A party!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We all ready?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Just one last thing. <i>Now</i> we're ready.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Is Applejack all set?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Actually, I haven't seen her all week.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Not since the stampede.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: But she'll be here for sure. Applejack is <i>never</i> late.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Welcome, everypony! Today we are here
to honor a pony we can always count on to help in matters great and
small. A pony whose contributions to--
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Did you see Applejack's slick moves out there? <i>What</i> an <i>athlete</i>. This week she's gonna help me with my new flying trick, and I know it's gonna be <i>so awesome</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Exactly</i>. And...
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: This week, I get to run Sugarcube Corner for the first time.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What does that have to do with Applejack?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>Oh</i>. Applejack, one of the best bakers <i>ever</i>, is gonna help me. Applejack makes everything great, so free samples for everypony!
</dd><dd>[ponies cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh-kay, that's great. Now if I could just make a point without being inter--
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Twilight?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: --<i>rupted</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Twilight, I'm so sorry, but I just wanted to mention that Applejack is also helping <i>me</i>
 this week with the official bunny census, where we count up all the new
 baby bunnies that were born this season. She's gonna help gather them
using her wonderful herding skills.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Anyone else</i>? <i>Anyone</i>? <i>No</i>? Well then, as I was trying to say... Urgh! <i>Never mind</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Mayor Mare</b>: Ah-ahem. And so, with no further ado, it is
my privilege to give the prize, Pony of Ponyville Award, to our beloved
guest of honor, a pony of the utmost trustworthiness, reliability, and
integrity. Ponyville's most capable and dependable friend: <i>Applejack</i>!
</dd><dd>[crowd cheer]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Cool! Way to go Applejack, that was awesome! I mean-- heh.
</dd><dd><b>Mayor Mare</b>: Ah-ahem.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: <i>Awkward</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: <i>I'm here</i>. <i>I'm here</i>. [yawn]
[sigh] Sorry I'm late--whoa--I was just... whoa... Did I get your tail?
Miss Mayor. Thank you kindly for this here... award thingy. [yawn] It's
so bright and shiny and, heh, heh heh, I sure do look funny heh.
Ooo-ooo.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Woo-ooo.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Ooo-ooo.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Okay</i>. Well, thank you Applejack for saving us from that scary stampede, and always being there for everypony.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [yawn] Yeah. I like helping the ponyfolks and [yawn] and stuff. [snore] Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, Thanks.
</dd><dd>[sounds of dragging metal]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Was it just me, or did Applejack seem a little--
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Tired?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Dizzy?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Messy? Well, did you <i>see</i> her mane?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: She seemed fine to me. Woo! Woo!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hmm.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [grunts] [sigh] Phew. [gasp] O-oah.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What on Earth is that pony <i>doing</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Whoops.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hey Applejack!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [snore]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Applejack.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [snore]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Applejack. Apple<i>JACK</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Oh, howdy, Twilight.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What <i>is</i> all this?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: It's Applebuck season. Whoa.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Apple<i>what</i> season?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Neh, It's what the Apple family calls harvestin' time. We gather all the apples from the trees so we can sell 'em.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But why are you doing it all alone?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: 'cause Big McIntosh hurt himself.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What about all those relatives I've met when I first came to Ponyville? Can't they help?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [sigh] They were just here for the Apple
family reunion. They actually live all over Equestria and are busy
harvestin' their own orchards. So, uh, I'm on my own. <i>Which means</i>, I should really get back to work. Ahem... <i>hint hint</i>? <i>Get back to work</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Fine.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Could you step aside, Twilight?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I just did. Applejack, you don't look so good.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Eh, don't any of you three worry none, I'm just fine and dandy. Whoa.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Do you... want some help?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Help? No way, no how.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But there's no way you can do it all on your own.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Is that a challenge?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Uhm... <i>no</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, I'm gonna prove to you that I can do it! Now if you'll <i>excuse</i> me, I've got apples to buck.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: There you are.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [yawn] I'm a mite sorry, Rainbow. I was busy
applebuckin' and I guess ah, I closed my eyes for a second and, when I
woke up, I was late. Now, what's this new trick a' yours?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: See this contraption?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh... Yeah.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, I'm gonna stand on one end, then
you're gonna jump down from that platform, launching me into the air
faster than I can take off on my own. Once I'm in the air, I'm gonna do
some <i>amazing</i> flips and spins that are sure to impress the Wonderbolts.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Isn't that a mite dangerous?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Pfft, Heh, not for a pony who can <i>fly</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, all right-y then. Oh my.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ready? One... two... THREE!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [crash]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Umm... maybe I wasn't clear. You're supposed to land <i>on</i> the other end.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Got it. [grunt] [grunt] [grunt]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Applejack, what the hay is going on? I mean, I thought I was working with Ponyville's best athlete!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: You <i>are</i>. I'm okay. Really. I-I have an idea. Watch this. [groan] <i>Ta da</i>! Oh... Maybe not. Okay, one more try. I'm sure to get it this time.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ugh!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Heh heh... Here I go!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Wait, Applejaaaaack!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: <i>You're welcome</i>!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [grunt]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Can I help you?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I think somepony else needs your help.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Applejack?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yep.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Ow!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Applejack, can we talk? <i>Applejack, can we talk?</i>
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: <i>Can bees squawk?! I don't think so.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No. Can we talk?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: <i>Twenty stalks? Bean or celery?</i>
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No! <i>I need to talk to you</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: <i>You need to walk to the zoo? Well, who's stoppin' you?</i>
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I <i>need</i> to <i>talk</i> to <i>you</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: <i>Oh! Well why didn't you say so? What you wanna talk about?</i>
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Rainbow Dash dropped in to see me today.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: <i>That's quite neighborly of her.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Yes, except that she crashed onto my balcony after you launched her into the air.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Oh, yeah. I wasn't feeling quite myself this morning.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Because you're working <i>too hard</i> and <i>you need help</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: What? Kelp? I don't need kelp. I don't even like seaweed.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: HELP! <i>You need HELP!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Nothin' doin', Twilight. I'm gonna prove to you, t'everypony, that I can do this <i>on my own</i>. Ow! Now if you'll <i>excuse</i> me, I've gotta go help Pinkie Pie.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ugh.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: Now Pinkie Pie, are you <i>sure</i> you're up for baking the muffins and running the store this afternoon?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yes siree bob, Mrs. Cake. Plus, I have Ponyville's prized pony to help me out. Why, she's the best baker <i>ever</i>. Right, Applejack?
</dd><dd><b>Mr. Cake</b>: No? You're not the best baker ever?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: WHAT? Oh no! I mean, don't you fret. I can bake anything from fritters to pies in the blink of an eye.
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: [sigh] All right. Well, see you later, girls!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Stop with the shakin', it's time to get bakin'.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: All right-y! I'll get the sugar and the eggs. Can you get me some chocolate chips?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Eh, uh, whu, what was that?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>Chocolate chips</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: <i>Chips</i>... got it. Tater chips, a little salty and dry, okie-dokie. What next?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>Baking soda</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: <i>Soda</i>. Perfect. That'll get the tater chips nice and wet. <i>Now what</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: A cup of flour.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: A cup o' sour? Well, lemons are sure sour. One cup o' sour, comin' up. Anything else, Pinkie?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: One last thing. Wheat germ.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Wheat worms? Oh, that must be fancy talk for earthworms.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Now <i>that's</i> gonna be <i>delicious</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: If you say so.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Free muffin sample spectacular!
</dd><dd>[ponies: mmm, muffins]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Yeah! Muffin spectacles! Get 'em while they're hot.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We came as soon as we heard.
</dd><dd><b>Nurse Redheart</b>: Oh thank you, Twilight. We need all the help we can get.
</dd><dd>[ponies moaning]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh no! What happened?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [sniff]
</dd><dd><b>Nurse Redheart</b>: It was a mishap with some of the baked goods.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No, not baked <i>goods</i>, baked <i>bads</i>. [groans]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Applejack</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [chomp] Want one?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [grunt] [snore] What? Huh? [grunt] [snore]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Applejack, we need to talk.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Wha, huh? Oh, it's you, Twilight. [yawn] I know what you're gonna say, but the answer is still <i>no</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Not to upset your applecart, but you <i>need</i> help.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hardy har. [groan] And no I don't.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Here, let me help.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Help? <i>No thanks</i>. [groan] A little more... [groan] Little... [grunt] There. I'll prove that this apple can handle <i>these</i> apples. Come on [grunt] apples [grunt] <i>fall off</i> [grunt].
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: AJ, think you're beating a dead... tree.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I knew that.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Actually, Applejack, I had something else to talk to you about. I just came back from Ponyville Urgent Care and--
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: You know, I'm a little busy to get lectured right now, Twilight.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But if you'd just let me help--
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Ugh. No, <i>no</i>, <i>NO</i>! How many times do I gotta say it? I don't need no help from nopony!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ugh. That pony is stubborn as a mule.
</dd><dd>[mule braying]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No offense.
</dd><dd><b>Mule</b>: None taken.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh Applejack! Thank you so much for offering your herding skills for the annual rabbit roundup.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Ugh. Why are we doin' this?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Well, lots of new baby bunnies have been born, so it's my job to get a count of all the new families.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Fine. Can we just get on with it?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Certainly, but remember, these are bunnies we're dealing with, not cows. They're a timid bunch and need to be treated gently.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I do NOT need any direction on corrallin' critters. Right, Winona?
</dd><dd><b>Winona</b>: [barks]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Okay, little bunnies! I need you to all gather here in the middle.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: That's right! Let's go, bunnies. In the center. <i>Hop to it</i>. Swell. Just <i>swell</i>. Put 'em up, Winona!
</dd><dd><b>Winona</b>: [barks]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Applejack! Winona! Stop! You're <i>scaring</i> them.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: We know what we're doin'. Get along, little bunnies.
</dd><dd><b>Winona</b>: [barks] [growls]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh no.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: <i>STAMPEDE</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Daisy</b>: [yelps] Stampede!
</dd><dd>[ponies scream]
</dd><dd>[rabbits running]
</dd><dd><b>Lily Valley</b>: [sigh]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [humming] [gasp]
</dd><dd><b>Rose</b>: The horror, the horror.
</dd><dd><b>Lily Valley</b>: It was <i>awful</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Daisy</b>: A <i>disaster</i>. A horrible, <i>horrible</i> disaster.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I don't get it.
</dd><dd><b>Lily Valley</b>: Our gardens, destroyed.
</dd><dd><b>Rose</b>: Every last flower, devoured.
</dd><dd><b>Daisy</b>: By... by... THEM!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh my. Oh... Please stop, little bunnies. Oh no! Please, let's go home. Oh my goodness.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: All right. <i>Enough is enough</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Must [gasp] keep [gasp] buckin'... just [gasp] a few [gasp] more. Must finish harvestin'.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: All right, Applejack. Your applebucking hasn't just caused <i>you</i>
 problems, it's over-propelled Pegasus', practically poisoned plenty of
ponies, and terrorized bushels of brand new bouncing baby bunnies. I
don't care <i>what</i> you say, <i>you</i>. <i>Need</i>. <i>Help</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [grunts] Ha! No, I don't. Look, I did it. I
harvested the entire Sweet Apple Acres without your help. How d'ya like
them apples?
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Um, how do <i>you</i> like <i>them</i> apples?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [mumbling] Where'd all the apple...? [mumbling] [sighs]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Applejack. Applejack.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Huh?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, good, you're okay. Now Applejack, I
 completely respect the Apple family ways. You're always there to help
anypony in need, so maybe you can put a little of your stubborn pride
aside and allow your friends to help you.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Okay, Twilight.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I am not taking "no" for an answer--<i>what</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Yes, Twilight. Yes, <i>please</i>. I could really use your help.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [chuckles] [sigh]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i>
</dd><dd><i>My friend Applejack is the best friend a pony could ever have, and she's always there to help anypony. The only trouble </i>is<i>,
 when she needs help, she finds it hard to accept it, so while
friendship is about giving of ourselves to friends, it's also about
accepting what our friends have to offer.</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><i>Your faithful student,</i>
</dd><dd><i>Twilight Sparkle</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: How about y'all take a little break? I got some <i>fine</i> apple juice waitin' for ya! [sigh] Girls, I can't thank you enough for this help. I was acting a <i>bit</i> stubborn.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: A <i>bit</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Okay. A mite stubborn, and I'm awful sorry.
Now, I know the town gave me the Prized Pony award, but the real award
is having you five as my friends.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Phew! That applebucking sure made me hungry.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: And I've got the perfect treat.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Eeew... Spike, I threw those all away. Where'd you get them?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: From the trash.
</dd><dd><b>Ponies</b>: [in unison] EW!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Just a little nibble? Come on.
</dd><dd><b>Ponies</b>: Ew! Gross!
