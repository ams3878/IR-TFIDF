</dd><dd><b>Angel</b>: [growls]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Don't worry, Angel, I won't forget you.
</dd><dd><b>Angel</b>: [munching]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [sighs] There's nothing so peaceful as a cuddly friends picnic.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: <i>Fluttershy!</i>
</dd><dd>[zip!]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [panting]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, goodness, Rarity! What's the matter?
</dd><dd>[screech]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, the better question would be, "What <i>isn't</i> the matter?"
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, dear. Do you wanna have some lettuce and talk about it?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Uh... Oh! I would love to, darling, but I just
don't have the time. The Canterlot Royal Fashion Show is practically
upon us, and the cornerstone piece of my collection just isn't working!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, that sounds serious.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh-ho-ho, it's serious. The entire collection is designed around it!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Do you need help knitting? I've started making tea cozies. It's an elephant.
</dd><dd>[fabric ripping]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Yes, well, I don't need help making clothes. Sassy Saddles is pitching in. Plus, I'll be pulling all <i>three</i> of my Manehattan assistants.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: All three? Does that mean you'll have to close Rarity For You?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: That's just it, darling. This is Manehattan's
busiest shopping season, and I can't just close the shop. So I was
hoping... you might consider running it?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Of course. I'm happy to help. Though I'm surprised you picked <i>me</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, I may have asked a few others.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Sorry, but we've got a Wonderbolts show coming up.
</dd><dd>[zoom!]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Sorry, but it's pie season and the pie orders are piling up.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Sorry, I've got a curriculum to make up.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Nope.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Nnnope.

<dl><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] My calendar's packed, but I hear Fluttershy's free. And you haven't asked Boulder.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Uh... Oh?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [chuckles] It doesn't matter who else I asked, because I couldn't be happier that you agreed to help!

<dl><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I think I forgot how big this shop was. How do you find anything?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, darling, it's <i>easy</i> to track. The
store is divided into sections – chic, classic, modern, sophisticated,
avant-garde, traditional, and obtuse. And, of course, each section is
divided by season, color, and price. It's a classic SCP system. Then
it's just a little ringing ponies up...
</dd><dd>[cash register keys clacking]
</dd><dd>[ka-ching!]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: ...a little fluff and fold... <i>Voilà!</i> But, of course, that's the <i>easy</i> part.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [gasps] It is?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Mm-hmm. As you well know, the real focus at Rarity For You is on the customer!
</dd><dd>[door opens, closes]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Care to give it a try?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, okay. [quietly] Hello. Um, welcome to Rarity For You. What can I help you with?
</dd><dd><b>Pursey Pink</b>: I need something classic but modern. Something with drama but also understated.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, aren't all those things opposites?
</dd><dd><b>Pursey Pink</b>: Yes. So?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: But how can I—?
</dd><dd><b>Pursey Pink</b>: I'm sorry. Are you asking <i>me</i> how to do <i>your</i> job?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: No! But I just, um—
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: If I may, I'm thinking noir-esque minimalist but with a twist. Perhaps a tapered hem.
</dd><dd>[dramatic music]
</dd><dd><b>Pursey Pink</b>: [gasps] It's like you read my mind! Are you a fashion psychic? [laughs]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Hmm. The inseams say, "Yes!"
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b> and <b>Pursey Pink</b>: [laugh]
</dd><dd>[ka-ching!]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Wow. You make it look so easy.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, darling, come now. You've conquered your
shyness a thousand times over. You can't let a few fashion ponies undo
all that progress.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I guess not.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: You simply must access your inner strength and allow it to shine through!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: How?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Uh, daily affirmations? Meditation? Ooh! Power posing works wonders whenever <i>I</i> feel intimidated. Try these. Confident warrior! Gold medalist! Showpony!
</dd><dd>[creaking]
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [clears throat] Or... not.
</dd><dd><b>Blue Bobbin</b>: We need to leave <i>now</i> if we're going to catch the train to Canterlot.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, goodness, look at the time! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, go, go! I'm right behind you!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: You're not gonna be here? In your work room?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: But, darling, I simply can't. The fashion show
is in Canterlot tomorrow, and I'll be up all night, even with the help
of all of my assistants!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [gulps]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, not <i>all</i> my assistants.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Smoky! Softpad! Smoky Jr.!
</dd><dd>[raccoons chittering]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh! [giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Ever since you convinced me to let them live in the shop, these beastie sweeties have been nothing but helpful.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: And I'm sure they'll help <i>me</i> let my inner strength shine through!
</dd><dd>[raccoons chittering]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, I wish I could stay and offer more help.
[gasps] Why not try a new outfit? Think of it as the costume for your
role as... Shop Pony! Ha ha! You know what they say – "clothes make the
pony".
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, <i>who</i> says that?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: You know, "them". All right. I'm sure you and your furry friends will do just fine. Ta-ta!
</dd><dd>[door opens, closes]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [sighs] I hope she's right.
</dd><dd>[door opens, closes]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Whew. Here goes nothing.
</dd><dd>[raccoons chittering]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Welcome to Rarity For You. What can I help you with?
</dd><dd><b>Bracer Britches</b>: What's the thread count of this shirt? I can't be seen in anything less than a thousand.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, thread... count? Um... Well, I'm not sure. Let's see... Um, one, two, three, four...
</dd><dd>[raccoons chittering]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, excuse me for just one second. [pants]
</dd><dd>[raccoons chittering]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, I'm afraid I don't know much about fashion to satisfy these customers. What am I gonna do?
</dd><dd>[raccoons chittering]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, I've never tried to act before, but... I suppose it's worth a shot.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [clears throat, snooty voice] Severe but not
unapproachable. Acceptable business attire. [normal voice] Oh, does that
 sound like a shop pony to you?
</dd><dd>[raccoons chittering]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [snooty voice] So sorry for the wait. The shop has some... staffing issues today.
</dd><dd><b>Bracer Britches</b>: Yes, well, I still haven't had an answer on this thread count.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Here at Rarity For You, our merchandise
defies typical attempts to quantify its quality, but rest assured, it
will make you the envy of all who see it.
</dd><dd><b>Bracer Britches</b>: Oh, in that case, I'll take three!
</dd><dd>[ka-ching!]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Ta-ta!
</dd><dd>[door opens, closes]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [normal voice, sighs, faints, pants, sighs]
Smoky Jr., I can't believe it worked! [snooty voice] I suppose clothes
really do make the pony after all.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Luckette</b>: I don't know about you, but <i>I</i> have a
full day of shopping planned. And if even one shop pony isn't up to my
standards, well, I shall make my displeasure quite plain.
</dd><dd><b>Strawberry Ice</b>: Oh, you are wicked! [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Canterlot fashion show or no, I simply can't leave Fluttershy to fend for herself with these Manehattanites. [panting]
</dd><dd><b>Bracer Britches</b>: Rarity?
</dd><dd>[screech]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, darling, I'm afraid I can't stop. Potential emergency at the boutique.
</dd><dd><b>Bracer Britches</b>: Oh, well, whatever it is, I'm quite certain the pony you left in charge can handle it. Oh, she's simply divine!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, well, I always knew Fluttershy had it in her. [laughs] And there's still time to catch the train to Canterlot!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [snooty voice] It's an unique play on the old
 standard. We call it a Rarity cut with a triple-cut stitched hem and a
guacamole chevka pattern fabric.
</dd><dd><b>Silver Berry</b>: Don't you mean "chevron"?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: If I had <i>meant</i> "chevron", then <i>that's</i> what I would've said.
</dd><dd><b>Silver Berry</b>:  [chuckles] Of course. It's so unique! So en vogue! It must be mine!
</dd><dd>[ka-ching!]
</dd><dd>[raccoons chittering]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [normal voice] Aw, thanks, everyone. But I feel I should push the snootiness further.
</dd><dd>[raccoons chittering]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: If you really <i>wanna</i> help, I suppose serving tea would be nice. Oh, if you don't mind.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[tea pouring]
</dd><dd><b>Old Money</b>: I like my accessories bold and shiny, and I'm just not seeing anything nearly bold and shiny enough.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [snooty voice] I'm afraid bold and shiny won't work with your whole... <i>modelle</i>. Perhaps... pointy.
</dd><dd><b>Old Money</b>: Pointy? Yes! I must have pointy!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Not everypony can pull off a found object, but you... nearly get there.
</dd><dd>[ka-ching!]
</dd><dd><b>Valley Trend</b>: [millennial accent] I need, like, a red
carpet glitz-and-glamour gown that's also casual, but, like, still artsy
 and a total head-turner.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Yes. Casual chic <i>prêt-à-porter</i> is very <i>branché</i> this season.
</dd><dd><b>Valley Trend</b>: Uhhh... Like, I don't understand any of that, so, like... I don't care about it?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, one moment, please.
</dd><dd>[zip!]
</dd><dd>[raccoons chitter]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [normal voice] Oh, I think I need a new character.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [hipster voice] Okay, I've got, like, this
high-key savage look for you? It's a totally live ensemble with a
little, like, thingies that sparkle and make the whole squad go, "Whoa!
That pony is 'woke'!"
</dd><dd><b>Valley Trend</b>: That is, like, exactly what I need!
</dd><dd>[raccoons chitter]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>"Snow Hope"</b>: This store is a desperate wasteland of nothingness. Do you have anything in black?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [hipster voice] Can you, like, chill for one sec? BRB.
</dd><dd>[zip!]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [goth voice] It's not like the futility of shopping can be made better with black leather and metal studs, but they help.
</dd><dd><b>"Snow Hope"</b>: Uh.... that jacket completes me.
</dd><dd><b>Joan Pommelway</b>: [spits] [British accent] This tea's, like, lukewarm. It's barely drinkable.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [snooty voice] This tea must always be at a precise temperature! See that it doesn't happen again!
</dd><dd>[raccoon chitter sadly]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [hipster voice] Whoa, that color is, like,
almost too lit for you? [goth voice] The blackness of this vest is a
reflection of your soul. [snooty voice] This hemline is nothing short of
 an inspiration of craftsponyship. Are you sure you deserve it?
</dd><dd>[music]
</dd><dd>[hoof pounding]
</dd><dd>[raccoons chittering]
</dd><dd>[slow motion sounds]
</dd><dd>[splash]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Mare E. Lynn</b>: [screaming]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [snooty voice] I don't know what's worse –
that you spilled the tea or that it's still cold! Either get it right or
 go back to the forest!
</dd><dd>[racoons chittering angrily]
</dd><dd>[dishes clatter]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, it is so hard to find good help these days.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[raccoons chittering]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Okay! Okay! Slow down, everyone! I'm doing my best!
</dd><dd>[raccoons chittering]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: So, Rarity is busy at an important fashion show,
and Fluttershy is running her shop in Manehattan, but to do it, she's
playing different shop pony characters that are all mean?
</dd><dd>[raccoons chittering happily]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: How in the world did you figure <i>that</i> out, Spike?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I'm not Dragon Charades champion for nothin'!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I can't imagine Fluttershy would <i>ever</i> be mean to her animal friends. This sounds serious. Spike, tell everyone it's time to head back to Saddle Row!
</dd><dd>[raccoons chittering]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [snooty voice] I wouldn't think it was possible to make something so dowdy even <i>more</i>
 matronly, but here you are. [goth voice] It's like a scream in the
void, empty and ultimately meaningless. [hipster voice] I would srsly
help you right now, but, like, I don't wanna, you know?
</dd><dd>[raccoons chittering]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You weren't kidding. This is worse than we thought! She's being horrible to everypony!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh, are you sure that's even Fluttershy?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Maybe it's just three really, really fast ponies that really, really look like her!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, let's find out! Hey, Fluttershy? Are you running the shop or performing in a one-pony show?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [snooty voice] If you don't mind, I can only improve the taste of <i>one</i>
 customer at a time. You'll have to wait your turn. Ugh, honestly! These
 small town ponies come to the big city and think they can behave any
way they please!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What?! <i>You</i> are a small-town pony! And your cottage isn't even <i>in</i> the town!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Look, Fluttershy, we came here because we were worried and we care about you.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [goth voice, to Neigh Sayer] Let's get out of this aura of positivity before it consumes us.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: As fun as this Fluttershy switcheroo game is, Smoky, Smoky Jr., and Softpad are really concerned.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Yeah! They came all the way to Ponyville to get us.
</dd><dd>[raccoons chittering]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [hipster voice] They should have, like, stayed there? The shop is, like, a no-rodent zone now.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>, <b>Pinkie Pie</b>, <b>Rainbow Dash</b>, <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>, and <b>Spike</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd>[raccoons gasping]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: She called them "rodents"?!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Fluttershy, I understand why you think you have to act this way for these customers, but there's gotta be a better way.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [snooty voice] [sarcastically] Goodness! You are so right. Please, step this way so that we may <i>discuss</i> your concerns.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I knew you'd come to your senses!
</dd><dd>[door slams]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [snooty voice] Indeed.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[crowd muttering]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Ugh, the centerpiece of my collection, and it's <i>still</i> not right! Oh, darling, I'm afraid we've literally run out of time. It's up to you! Go out there and sell it! Now, attitude!
</dd><dd>[ponies cheering, cameras clicking]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I don't understand. When I left Fluttershy, she had everything well in hoof.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, things might have seemed all right when you left, but they're definitely not all right now.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: She's actin' worse than the worst Manehattanite I ever saw!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: She kicked us out of the shop!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: She called Smoky, Smoky Jr., and Softpad... "rodents"!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Wh-wh-wha... <i>Rodents</i>?! Well, why didn't you say that from the start?! She obviously needs help! Come on!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [goth voice] Your melancholy is way too shallow for a look with this much unfeeling depth.
</dd><dd><b>"Snow Hope"</b>: Huh.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [hipster voice] Ugh! Your style isn't even on the same page? Turn away. Don't even look at it, okay?
</dd><dd><b>Valley Trend</b>: [gasps] I can't even!
</dd><dd>[magic noises]
</dd><dd>[hooks sliding]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [snooty voice] I think not, dear! This is all far too fashion forward for the likes of <i>you</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Bracer Britches</b>: Ugh! Well, I never!
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd>[door slams]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [sighs] Told ya it was bad.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Bad? This is worse than I could've possibly imagined!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [snooty voice] Rarity! I'm so glad you're
here! [kissing noises] Finally, a pony who understands that the couture
in this shop is far too brilliant to even consider selling!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Whaaat?!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [hipster voice] You, like, totally get how
lame customers are? Ugh! [goth voice] Watching them leave filled me with
 a sweet sadness. [snooty voice] And you'll be pleased to hear that I've
 taken care of your rodent situation.
</dd><dd>[raccoons chittering]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Will somebody tell her to stop saying that?!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: That's <i>it!</i> Fluttershy, I'm afraid you've left me no choice! You are <i>terminated!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [snooty voice] Well! Good luck replacing <i>me</i>! Humph!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [sighs] Well, thankfully I— [shrieks]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [goth voice] I always thought she was too controlling.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: You— you— you are terminated, too!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [goth voice] Whatever.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Now, I— [shrieks]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [hipster voice] I know, right? I mean, uh, ugh?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Actually, you're, like, totally terminated as well!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [hipster voice] Like, okay.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [sighs] Well, I'm glad that's over— [shrieks]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [normal voice] I guess I owe everypony an apology.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [sighs] You think?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I got so caught up trying to please all of your customers that—
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What customers?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I might have taken my salespony characters a little too far.
</dd><dd>[pumping]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [to raccoons] I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. You know I was only pretending, right?
</dd><dd>[raccoons chittering]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But, Fluttershy, why did you think you needed to be somepony else to run the shop?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I guess acting like the ponies of Saddle Row gave me the confidence to interact with them.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Darling, I'd never trust some horrible Saddle Row pony to run my shop. That's why I wanted a friend to do it.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Well, I'd definitely rather be myself anyway, even if I don't exactly have what it takes to be a shop pony.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I wouldn't sell yourself short. Those salespony characters all came from you!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah! I think you totally have what it takes.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Maybe a little <i>too</i> much.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Indeed. You have all the inner strength you need, but I think we prefer it coming from our sweet, regular Fluttershy.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>, <b>Pinkie Pie</b>, <b>Rainbow Dash</b>, and <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: And that's just given me the inspiration I'm looking for!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: And last one... There! The missing piece for my new collection – the Warrior of Inner Strength!
</dd><dd>[mane cast and ponies cheering and applauding]
</dd><dd>[raccoons chittering]
</dd><dd><b>Pony</b>: Oh, gorgeous!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, it's lovely, Rarity! I'm just sorry you had to leave the Canterlot Royal Fashion Show early.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, darling, making the perfect dress is scads more satisfying than showing it off.
</dd><dd>[customers chattering]
</dd><dd><b>Blueberry Curls</b>: Ooh, striking dress, Rarity. I
certainly hope you aren't trying to undercut the Royal Fashion Show by
ducking out and debuting it here.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: What? No, I—
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [snooty voice] Have <i>you</i> considered
the possibility that the Royal Fashion Show is trying to undercut
Rarity's by continuing on in Canterlot and not moving the whole affair
here?! Hmm?! Have you?! Hmmm?!
</dd><dd><b>Blueberry Curls</b>: I, uh... No.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [snooty voice] Hmph! Just as I thought! Hmmm!
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [to Rarity] Oh! [giggles] Inner strength.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b> and <b>Rarity</b>: [laughing]
