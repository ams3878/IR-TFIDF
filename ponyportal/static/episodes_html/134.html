<dl><dd><b>Discord</b>: Tea?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Trendy coats? Bedrolls? Saddlebags? Oh! A
surprise vacation just for the two of us? How thoughtful. I hear Puerto
Caballo is lovely this time of year. Sand like powdered sugar. [blows]
</dd><dd>[sprinkling]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, Princess Celestia's taking us on an overnight goodwill tour of Yakyakistan. I just found out.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>:<b> </b>[gasps] So what you're saying is no tea? Ugh. Well. [clears throat] That's fine. I wasn't thirsty anyway.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: If you're looking for something to do, you could spend the evening with Spike and Big Mac.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [laughs]
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: You aren't kidding.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: They're very nice. They have a "top secret"
thing they do whenever we leave Ponyville. Although everypony knows
about it, so it's not a very good secret. I think you'd have fun with
them.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Fun? With sidekicks? Oh, you must think that
we're in a dimension where everything is opposite. [snap] "Da-dee-la!
I'm Opposite Discord, and I want to hang out with Spike and Big Mac! I'm
 sure I'd have fun!"
</dd><dd><b>Opposite Fluttershy</b>: <i>Well, guess what, Sassafras?! I'm Opposite Fluttershy, and I'm sick of being nice and quiet all the time!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [snap] Let me explain it to you as simply as I
can. Me? Amazing! Them? Well, I've already forgotten who we're talking
about. You see?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: All I'm saying is it's an opportunity to expand your circle of friends. [coddling] Unless you're afraid they won't like you?
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Oh, please. Don't stoop to tedious reverse psychology. You're better than that.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: It never hurts to make new friends.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [scoffs] Consider it considered.
</dd><dd>[magic poof]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [humming] [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Couldn't I just come with you instead?

</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [gasps] Well, it's not <i>my</i> fault the new train route leads into an active volcano. Guess you'll have to stay.

 resident Yakyakistan expert.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Nope! I brought yeti food!
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Did I forget to mention there's a pony-eating yeti on Frost Field Glacier? We're gonna have so much fun!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Heh. If he messes with us, I'll turn that yeti into confetti!
</dd><dd>[train whistle blows]

</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Heh. Somepony's in an awful quick hurry to get us out of here. Don't y'all have too much fun without us.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I bet you boys have big plans. Right, Spike?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.
Although if I did, I certainly wouldn't be allowed to discuss it with
you girls.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Buh-bye!

</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Fascinating article, yes? [nervous laugh] [hushed, to himself] Don't let them come over, <i>please</i>
 don't let them come over, please don't let them come over, please,
please, please— [normal] Oh, salutations, my friend! Wish I could stay
and chat, but I don't want to.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Wait! Um, we were wondering... What are you up to tonight?
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [to himself] Oh, here we go...
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Do you wanna, I don't know, hang out? Is that, like, something you do?
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Oh, Twilight's friend and Applejack's monosyllabic brother, if only I weren't super busy this evening.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [to Big McIntosh] I guess guys' night will just be you and me.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: A guys' night? You mean a rowdy evening of reckless revelry? Zoot suits, fedoras, swing dancing?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Eh, something like that. [nervous] You should totally come. Three of us would be way better than two...
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: That does sound fun, actually...
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Too bad you're busy.
</dd><dd>[magic zap]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Well, I suppose I could squeeze you in if I move a few very important ponies around.
</dd><dd>[click]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [gravelly accent] June, honey, be a dear.
Reschedule Luna and Cay-Cay. [normal, aside] That's what I call Princess
 Celestia, what a hoot! [gravelly accent] In fact, clear the whole
evening. Tonight is guys' night. These fellas invited me to spice things
 up and bring a little class to the whole affair.
</dd><dd>[magic zap]

</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [normal voice] Tonight will be the best night of your lives, and not just because you get to bask in my greatness.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I do like basking in things. See you tonight. [hushed] Twilight's castle. The fun starts promptly at sundown.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Technically, the fun starts when I arrive, but I'll make sure it's around sunset. Adieu, fellas.

bedlam... [imitating fanfare] Discord!
</dd><dd>[electronic music playing]
</dd><dd>[confetti exploding]
</dd><dd>[magic zap]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: So, shall we hop to it? I made a list of the rowdiest establishments in Ponyville. It's rather short.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Actually, we're staying here. I hope you like awesome games!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Games? I love games. I'm great at games.
</dd><dd>[magic zap]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Famous pony charades? Oh, this is an easy one. Who am I? Huh? Huh?
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Oh, come on!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Uh... I'm talkin' about a <i>real</i> game.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Oh, you mean like trapping best friend ponies in hedge mazes and turning them against each other. Those were the days.
</dd><dd>[Celestia's mane yowls]
</dd><dd>[magic zap]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Not exactly. Wait here.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Whatever it is, it can only get better by adding me to the mix.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [off-screen] Okay!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[click]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: In a world where evil reigns supreme, a small band of warriors stands tall against the darkness. This is... <i>Ogres &amp; Oubliettes</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [gasps]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Discord</b>: Oh, this looks like...
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: The best game ever? You're right!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Yes...
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: <i>Ogres &amp; Oubliettes</i> is a fantasy
role-playing adventure game. Our goal, defeat the evil Squid Wizard,
or... [stifling laughter] as we call him... the Squizard!
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: [stifled laughter]
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [chuckling] [clears throat] The Squizard has laid
 siege to the last free city in Spiketopia. That's the name of the land.
 He's kidnapped a beautiful unicorn princess named Shmarity. [beat] Uh,
which is like a normal name in Spiketopia, so, you know, don't think
about it too much.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Fear not. Your romantic delusions are safe with me.
</dd><dd>[zip!]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: First things first – you've gotta create a character! Name?
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: How about... Discord?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [sighs] The whole point of the game is you get to
 use your imagination to be someone you're not. I'm Garbunkle, a famous
magician. Everyone treats me with the utmost respect.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Just like in real life?
</dd><dd>[crack]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: And don't get jealous, but I'm a level 30 Enchanter with major skill points assigned to Intellect and Perception.
</dd><dd>[hairdryer running]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [not listening] Go on, I'm listening.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Big Mac's character is Sir McBiggun, a level 27 Black Knight Unicorn from Castle Chadwick!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [still not listening] I'm listening.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: When his king aligned himself with the Squizard, Sir McBiggun would not besmirch his honor.
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Nnope!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [clears throat] [mumbling] I'm listening.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: And so it came to pass, the magician and black knight vowed to rid Spiketopia of the evil Squizard.
</dd><dd>[balloon deflating]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: So, your character's name?
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: I already have the best name in the universe. Why would I change it for something like "Captain Wuzz"?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Captain Wuzz it is!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [groans]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: What class are you, Captain Wuzz? There's Archers, Mages, Rogues...
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [snorts] Can I suggest we take a break and, I don't know, go out and have some fun? Ponyville's not going to paint itself red.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: You'll love it once we get started! [rolls die] How 'bout an Archer?
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Sounds just as miserable as the other options. So fine.
</dd><dd>[tok]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Sir McBiggun, are you prepared to enter the world of <i>Ogres &amp; Oubliettes</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Discord, or should I say, Captain Wuzz, are you—
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Oh, get on with it.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [rolls dice] We find ourselves trapped in the dungeon of the evil Squizard. The bars are locked tight.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: The bars exist in our <i>imagination</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Really? You describe things, and then we pretend it's real?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: It is real. In our <i>imagination</i>. It's your turn first. What do you wanna do?
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Curse myself for attending this infernal evening? Ohhh, no, you mean in the game.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Well, you can do whatever you want. Then, I roll this twenty-sided die and see if you're successful.
</dd><dd>[clang]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: I stick my head through the bars and demand for the immediate release of the Lord of Chaos.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: That's a big risk. You have to roll a seventeen or higher to succeed. [rolls die] Ooh, bad idea. The guard gets mad.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: This spell here. I transform him into a parsnip.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: You need eleven Intelligent points to cast a Transform Into Root Vegetable spell.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: I'm not intelligent? I cast it anyway because this game is stupid.
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [rolls die] The spell backfires. So [stifling laughter] your claws grow leaves and transform into parsnips!
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: [chuckling] Parsnips. [laughs]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [growls]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: The guard laughs. He calls his friends over, and they laugh too.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b> and <b>Big McIntosh</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Don't you laugh at me, Big Mac! Does it really say that? Let me see.
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [rolls die] [laughs] As you get angrier, everypony laughs harder!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: I seal Sir McBiggun in a magic bubble until he stops laughing!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I told you, you can't do magic!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b> and <b>Big McIntosh</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd>[magic zap]
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Whoaa! Nope! Nope! Nope!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: "Not intelligent enough." Please.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Cut it out, Discord!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Oh, this game is insufferable! Let me show you a <i>real</i> guys' night!
</dd><dd>[snap]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[upbeat jazz]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [laughing] This is the life! Jazz, dancing, the
 best table magic can buy! This is what guys' night is all about. Am I
right, fellas?
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I know you probably didn't do this on purpose, but this table's the perfect size and shape!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: I don't think so. Let's have a drink. Chocolate milkshakes?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [sighs] No, we want to go back to <i>Ogres &amp;</i>—
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Oh, how 'bout a different game? [magic zap] Those are <i>very</i> bad cards.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Stop messing with us! We wanna—
</dd><dd>[magic zap]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: A dance contest?
</dd><dd>[upbeat jazz BGM]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Surprise! We won!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: <i>Discord!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [sinister] Yes?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Look, we don't wanna do these things. We wanna
play our game. If you don't want to play with us, you can, I don't know,
 sit and watch.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Sit and watch? Fine. We'll play your game. [reverberating] Are you ready to enter the world of <i>Ogres &amp; Oubliettes</i>?

Farewell, Garbunkle the magician and brave Sir McBiggun. May providence
smile upon thee in thy quest to rid Spiketopia of the dreaded

bad.
