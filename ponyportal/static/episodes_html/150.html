</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: [grunting] It's just...
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: You wanna come. But we talked about this. Non-Pegasus ponies fall through the clouds.

</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: It'll be fine. Besides, how <i>else</i> could I get there?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: A Pegasus chariot?
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: A flock of birds?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: A hot-air balloon?

</dd><dd><b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Our Rainbow Dash?

this scrapbook for my report! I'm her biggest fan!
</dd><dd><b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Now, little trotter, what you say is impossible. [excitedly] Because nopony is a bigger fan of our Rainbow Dash than us!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Whoa! You always wear that shirt?
</dd><dd><b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Heh. Actually, it's, uh, laundry day. But pretty great, right?!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Yeah!
</dd><dd><b>Windy Whistles</b>: My name's Windy Whistles, and I just
have to say that it is a total blast to meet somepony that loves Rainbow
 Dash as much as we do!
</dd><dd><b>Bow Hothoof</b>: What can we help you with?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Well, I know all about Rainbow Dash's time in Ponyville, but I don't know <i>anything</i> about her life before that.

 childhood kitchen! <i>This is the greatest day of my life!</i> [munches loudly] Mmmm!

</dd><dd><b>Windy Whistles</b>: And look at this! She was wearing it when she spoke her first words.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: So cool!
</dd><dd>[camera flashes]
</dd><dd><b>Windy Whistles</b>: And this broken lantern is from when she first learned to fly.

</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: So where's all the Wonderbolt stuff?
</dd><dd><b>Bow Hothoof</b>: You mean Rainbow Dash's personal collection of Wonderbolt memorabilia?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: No. I mean, where's all the stuff about
Rainbow Dash getting accepted into the Wonderbolt Academy and then
getting chosen as a Wonderbolt? Wait, you don't know that your
daughter's a Wonderbolt? And I got to tell you?!
</dd><dd><b>Bow Hothoof</b> and <b>Windy Whistles</b>: Uhhhhhhhhh...

</dd><dd><b>Bow Hothoof</b> and <b>Windy Whistles</b>: [cheering loudly] She's a Wonderbolt!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh, no.
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: Okay. Which pony broke protocol and invited guests to our training exercises?!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I guess they're with me. [groans, embarrassed] Mom, Dad. So... good... to see you.
</dd><dd><b>Windy Whistles</b>: Oh, honey, it's so great to see you, too! And wow! You were so amazing up there with all of that flying!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, how did you know I was here?
</dd><dd><b>Windy Whistles</b>: Scootaloo filled us in on everything, you modest pony you!
</dd><dd>[camera flashes]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I can't believe I'm documenting the moment your parents first saw you as a Wonderbolt!
</dd><dd><b>Windy Whistles</b>: And these must be your Wonderbolt
friends! Hello, team! I'm Windy Whistles, the mom of the best Wonderbolt
 ever! Yeah! Just kidding. You guys were great, too! Go, team!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Moooom!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [chuckles]
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: Hello, ma'am. Nice to meet you.
</dd><dd><b>Windy Whistles</b>: Nice to meet you as well, and love those
 goggles! Love 'em! You know, I have goggles, too. But they're mostly
just for swimming. Oh, and bath time.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Mom, please! They don't wanna hear about your bath time!
</dd><dd><b>Bow Hothoof</b>: I can't believe it! My daughter, a Wonderbolt! [sobs] So proud!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Dad, hold it together. We're in public.
</dd><dd><b>Bow Hothoof</b>: I know! I know, i— but it's... just... You had a goal, and... you achieved it! [sobs]
</dd><dd>[camera flashes]
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: All right, Wonderbolts! Let's hit the showers and give Rainbow Dash some time to spend with her family.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Okay, yeah! Uh, great practice! I'll, uh, eh, catch up with you guys in a minute!
</dd><dd><b>Fleetfoot</b>: Sir, you really raised a great flyer!

</dd><dd><b>Bow Hothoof</b>: [continues sobbing]
</dd><dd>[camera flashes]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Could you give us a sec?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Is something wrong?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah. You should've warned me that you were bringing my parents! Or talked to Twilight or something! Not just shown up!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Why?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ugh! It's just my parents and I have a
delicate relationship. I love them very much, and we're really close,
but there's a reason I didn't tell them I'm a Wonderbolt! They can be a
little bit... embarrassing.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Huh? Really?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, really! And now you've invited a whole lot of crazy into my life!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: What's wrong with a little support?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Bow and Windy, I'd like you to meet Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Hi!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Hello.
</dd><dd><b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Greetings, small ponies.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Are you excited to see Rainbow Dash?
</dd><dd><b>Windy Whistles</b>: Oh, my, yes! And to think we never bothered to come to a Wonderbolt event!
</dd><dd><b>Bow Hothoof</b>: We said if Rainbow Dash isn't a Wonderbolt, then what's the point? But now, she is!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: And she earned it! Did you know it all
started when she won a spot in the coveted Wonderbolts Academy, training
 under Spitfire?
</dd><dd><b>Windy Whistles</b>: I didn't know that! How wonderful!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: But then, she had some heavy competition. Especially against another Pegasus named Lightning Dust.
</dd><dd><b>Windy Whistles</b>: Oh, no!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: But, of course, Rainbow Dash proved to be the best and later made it into the Wonderbolt Reserves!
</dd><dd><b>Windy Whistles</b>: Hooray again!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: But jealous ex-Wonderbolt Wind Rider was
worried that Rainbow Dash might break his speed record. And so, he
framed her for a crime she didn't commit.
</dd><dd><b>Windy Whistles</b>: Oh, no!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: But thanks to Rarity, Rainbow Dash proved her
 innocence and became a backup Wonderbolt until Fire Streak retired, and
 she became an <i>official</i> Wonderbolt!
</dd><dd><b>Windy Whistles</b>: Hooray! Wow, what a gripping tale!
</dd><dd><b>Bow Hothoof</b>: You really know your Rainbow Dash history. You're going to do great on your report.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Show's about to start.
</dd><dd>[Wonderbolts' theme playing]

</dd><dd><b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Rip it up and tear! It! Down!
</dd><dd><b>Windy Whistles</b>: Then build it back up again and tear it back down again! Yeah!
</dd><dd><b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Woo! Yeah! Uh-huh, uh-huh! Go go go! Yes! Go, Rainbow Dash! Best Wonderbolt ever!
</dd><dd><b>Windy Whistles</b>: Woo-hoo! That's my daughter! Go, Rainbow! Go, Dashie, go-go-go-go-go!
