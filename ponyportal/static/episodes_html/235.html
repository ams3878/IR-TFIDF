</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b> and <b>Wallflower Blush</b>: Oof!
</dd><dd>[papers flapping]
</dd><dd><b>Wallflower Blush</b>: Excuse me.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I'm sorry. I didn't see you come in.
</dd><dd><b>Wallflower Blush</b>: I've been here for a while.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I didn't realize.
</dd><dd><b>Wallflower Blush</b>: I've been trying to get your attention for, like, half the song.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [softly] Ain't she a quiet one?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah. And we know some pretty shy people. Am I right?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: We do? Who?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I'm Sunset Shimmer. President of the
Yearbook Committee and editor-in-chief. Do you want to join? We could
always use extra help.
</dd><dd><b>Wallflower Blush</b>: I'm Wallflower Blush.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Nice to meet you.
</dd><dd><b>Wallflower Blush</b>: I've been on the Yearbook Committee all year.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Oh! Um...
</dd><dd><b>Wallflower Blush</b>: We met in ninth-grade English.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: And... I was... saying it was nice to meet you then. You didn't let me finish.
</dd><dd><b>Wallflower Blush</b>: Anyway, I counted up all the votes for the yearbook Superlatives.
</dd><dd><b>Equestria Girls</b>: [clamoring]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [reading] "Most Likely to Succeed",
"Best Smile", "Class Clown." [gasp] Ooh! We won "Best Friends"!
Applejack, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, Pinkie Pie, Twilight
Sparkle, and me!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I always knew I liked you all, but now it's official! In yearbook form! The people have spoken!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, good for Micro Chips. "Most Likely to Invent Cold Fusion". Not a reason to be jealous. Pfft! I'm not! [laughs]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Don't worry, Twilight. We know you're a genius.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Besides, it's just the yearbook.
</dd><dd><b>Equestria Girls</b>: [gasp]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Just the yearbook?!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [groans] Now ya gone and done it!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: The student body has entrusted me with
the responsibility of gathering their memories into the pages of this
book. In thirty years, we might not remember everything, but we <i>will</i> remember what's in the yearbook.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, I'm entrusting you not to put us
next to "Best Muscles". Every time you close the book, it'll be like
we're kissing Bulk Biceps!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh. Uh, why don't we take our picture at the beach on Saturday? Everyone's bound to look adorable.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Beach day! I'll make my world-famous
fun-in-the-sun cupcakes. [whispers, to Fluttershy] The secret ingredient
 is edible sunscreen! It's SPF fun-hundred!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Yech.
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: The Great and Powerful Trixie demands to speak to the yearbook editor immediately!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Unfortunately for me, that's me. What do you want, Trixie?
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: Ha! Just as I suspected! I was not voted "Greatest and Most Powerfullest"! Explain yourself!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: How should I put this? You didn't win "Greatest and Most Powerful" because it wasn't one of the Superlatives.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: Hmm. Neither was "Biggest Meanie", but that didn't stop you from winning it our freshman year.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: That was different. The whole school voted for her.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: She was soooooooo mean.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Of course, we all know you've earned the right not to be remembered that way.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Thanks. [to Trixie] We're not having a "Greatest and Powerfullest" Superlative. Sorry.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: Oh, <i>you're</i> the one who'll be
sorry, Sunset Shimmer! When you least expect it, I'll have my revenge,
and then I'll disappear! Like this! Behold! The Magician's Exit!
</dd><dd>[poof!]
</dd><dd><b>Equestria Girls</b>: [cough]
</dd><dd>[door handle jiggling]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Allow me. We were actually on our way out.
</dd><dd>[door unlocks]
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: Hmph!
</dd><dd><b>Equestria Girls</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Wallflower Blush</b>: I'll just finish up...
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Ooh. Forgot to turn off the lights.
</dd><dd><b>Wallflower Blush</b>: ...in the dark.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [voiceover] <i>Dear Princess Twilight, I
thought you'd be happy to hear that the girls and I were voted "Best
Friends" in the yearbook today. After all, if you hadn't forgiven me,
I'd still be the arrogant student I was when I left Equestria. You gave
me the second chance I didn't deserve, and I'll never forget it. Your
friend, Sunset Shimmer.</i>

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Group picture, practice run #36-A,
attempt seven — success! Oh, no! [grunting] Your eyes do not deceive
you. I finally invented a selfie-sensing camera. It hovers into position
 whenever it detects a selfie opportunity. [grunts]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I prefer to take selfies myself... ie.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Which beach blanket should we use for the photograph?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You mean the white one? Or the white one?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [gasps] This is toasted oat and linen lamb's wool. Eggshell, warm frost, pale nimbus, and... Well, that one <i>is</i> white, I suppose.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah. That's the one I was talking about.
</dd><dd>[wind blowing, waves rushing in]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Don't worry, Rarity! I got it!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No, I got it! I got it!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Nuh-uh! I got it! I got it!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b> and <b>Spike</b>: [yell] I don't got it.
</dd><dd>[filtered breathing]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] Ocean monster! Ocean monster!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [yells]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Quincy the sea turtle says the tide's coming
 in. We should take the picture soon or risk having damp ankles. Oh,
he's so thoughtful.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Ick.
</dd><dd>[drone beeping]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Mwah.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Oh. Twilight, you got the Selfie Sensor working?
</dd><dd>[hovering and beeping]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: O... kay. So, who's ready to take a "Best Friends" picture?
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Uh-oh. What did I do?
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Should we do it now, or... did you wanna swim first? How's the water?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Sunset Shimmer? Askin' to be in <i>our</i> "Best Friends" picture? Heh. Now I've heard it all.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Am I missing the joke here?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: The only joke is whatever this is you're playing on us, acting all nice like you're our friend.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: And it's not funny!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Because you aren't nice.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: And we <i>ain't</i> friends.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Wait. What?!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: You got applesauce in your ears? I said, we ain't fr— Whoa!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: You sure can.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [squee]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: I'm so sorry.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>[Sunset Shimmer]</b>
<dl><dd>My friends are here to bring me 'round...
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [gasps] It's like I've been... erased!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: This has to be a bad dream. Wake up, Sunset. Wake up!
</dd><dd>[poink!]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Ow!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Nope. You're awake. Ow! [giggles] Me, too! [giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [to Rainbow Dash] What about you?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[motorbikes zooming]
</dd><dd>[screeching]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: No! Rainbow Dash, you <i>saved</i> me in that race!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What are you talking about?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I can see your memories, and I'm not in them!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: And exactly how is it you can see our memories, if you don't mind me askin'?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: With this!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, pfft! It's obviously a cheap knockoff of ours.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: We got them together. You were there, remember?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Why is she still talking to us?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Pinkie Pie, what about when I came to your sleepover before the Battle of the Bands?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ha! The closest you've ever come to a party
of mine is freshman year, when you pretended to be Applejack and texted
me, "Your party is lamer than a hungry duck in snow boots."
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Like I'd ever say that.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: It really hurt my feelings.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: And it wasn't very nice to the ducks, either.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: That was a long time ago. Twilight, you remember me, right? We've been through so much together. Please...
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I only met you once, when you yelled at me at the Games.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Doesn't anyone remember that I've changed?!
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Maybe not any<i>one</i>. I'll be right back!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Don't hurry back, darling!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [sighs] Dear Princess Twilight, this is gonna sound crazy, but... are we friends? Am I... nice? Please answer...
</dd><dd>[shimmering]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: [voiceover] <i>Of course we're friends!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [sighs]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: [voiceover] <i>Are you okay? What's going on?</i>
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [voiceover] <i>Kinda hard to explain. Might be easier in person. Well, not "person", so to speak...</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[warbling]
</dd><dd>[zapping]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Twilight!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: Sunset?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Aah! Oops! [laughs] I was trying to hug you.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: So, what's been happening?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: This is bad, Sunset. It's way beyond anything I've ever heard of. Although...
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: What?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: I just had an idea. But you might not like it.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I'll do anything to get my friends back, Twilight.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: There is one pony who might be able to help, but I don't know if you two want to see each other.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Who? ...Oh.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[doors open]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: Sooo, Princess Celestia... [nervous laugh] You'll never guess who's back! Actually, maybe you <i>can</i> guess, 'cause she's right here. But, um...
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: [whispering, to Sunset] Am I helping?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [sighs] Princess Celestia, the last time we saw each other, I was your snide little pupil who betrayed and abandoned you.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: [whispering] I wouldn't have said it <i>that</i> way. [clears throat] What Sunset means to say is—
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I mean that I come before you a changed pony, humbly asking for forgiveness, guidance, and knowledge.
</dd><dd>[tense music]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Or I can just go, and you never have to see me again.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: I've missed you, Sunset Shimmer.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I... I'm so sorry.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: [squee]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: I am not familiar with the exact spell
 that could have erased your friends' memories. But it sounds like
Equestrian magic is at work in your world.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: Hmm. Indeed. The toilings of this nefarious enchantment could portend unimaginable catastrophe if left unchecked.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [stifles giggle]
</dd><dd>[slap!]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Sorry. I'm just used to hearing you say no student parking in the faculty lot. Heh-heh.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: This "faculty lot" you speak of sounds like a place of great power.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b> and <b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: [giggle]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: The answers you seek are in the Canterlot Library.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: There's over a million books in here.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: I wish! But don't worry.
You're looking at somepony who knows this place like the back of her
hoof. Where are you going, Princess Celestia?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: To the restricted section.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: There's a... a reh... a reh... a reh... [hyperventilating]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Breathe, Twilight.
</dd><dd>[clank!]
</dd><dd>[door opening]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[bats squeaking]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: [prolonged gasp]
Oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh! So many books
all unread! Ancient historical artifacts! [gasps] I just... I
thought...! I can't...! [wheezes]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: You sure you're up for helping me go through all this stuff?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Don't take this away from me!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: I should warn you, however. The archives' mechanical catalog has not been... well-maintained.
</dd><dd>[cranking]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [coughing]
</dd><dd>[machine falling apart]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: Guess we'll have to read <i>everything</i>! C'mon! No way! Can you believe they have <i>Canterlot Cantabiles Volume Thirty-One</i>? You heard me! <i>Thirty-One</i>! Sunset, that's when it gets goooooooood! [gasps] Over here! An original <i>Windigo Weather Warning</i> from the pre-Equestrian era! Oh, my goodness! I can't! I just can't!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b> and <b>Princess Celestia</b>: [laugh]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [yawning, tiredly] Did you know
Chancellor Puddinghead tried to pass a law mandating Earth ponies drink
carrot juice at every meal? I do. Know that. Now.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: Awww. Sounds like you got to read all the fun books. [yawns] We should probably take a break from looking...
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [sighs]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: Because I found something! You're familiar with <i>The Seven Trials of Clover the Clever</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Obviously. Why?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, first of all, these date back to before the founding of Equestria. Look at this.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: "The Memory Stone". That sounds promising.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: It belonged to an evil
sorceress who was practically invincible. With the Memory Stone, she
could erase any memory from anypony. Even fragments of memories.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Fragments like... memories of me being nice?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: Mm-hmm. Clover the Clever
knew the sorceress had to be stopped and the Stone destroyed, so he
chased her across land and sea. But every time he got close, the
sorceress would erase his memory and escape. But he kept finding her.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: How?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: These scraps of parchment. He
 secretly wrote everything down so he'd know what had happened and where
 to go next. Like a trail of bread crumbs.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Clever! Ohhhh. Clover the— Yeah, got it. What happened on the other side of this portal?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: The last page is missing.
Clover must've hid it to keep anypony else from finding the Memory
Stone. Sunset, what if the Memory Stone ended up in <i>your</i> world?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: And someone is using it to make everyone hate me again?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b> and <b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: But <i>who</i>?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: We’ve been out here a while. Time to reapply!
</dd><dd>[squishing]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I've been thinking... Should we be worried about Sunset Shimmer?
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: Yeah! Worried she comes back! I think
it's a shame the way she's treating you, pretending to be your friend.
She's obviously up to something. Sunset thinks the whole school exists
just to serve her. [snaps, to Snips and Snails] Water, please! [to the
Equestria Girls] You know, seeing as how the yearbook president seems to
 be having a little identity crisis, I believe that means the vice
president takes over. And, why... [gasps] that's <i>you</i>, Rarity!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: If this is your way of asking to be made "The
Greatest and Most Powerful", the answer is no. And didn't we have this
conversation yesterday? I can't quite remember.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh...
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Hmm.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: Maybe we did, maybe we didn't. Memory
is such a fickle thing. You never know when you'll forget something
important. Like how Great and Powerful <i>I</i> am, which is why I need to be in the yearbook!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [groans] I'll think about it.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: That's all I ask.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I should be getting back to my world.
Maybe I can convince my friends I'm telling the truth, now that I know
what we're looking for.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: The Memory Stone. I'll stay
here and search the restricted section top to bottom until I find a way
to get your friends' memories back.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: If that's even possible.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, it's possible. Even if I
have to reorganize the whole library by subject. Or maybe
chronologically! Oh! And fix the broken catalog machine... [clears
throat] I'll figure it out.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Thank you. Both of you.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: This is quite a contrast from the
last time we parted ways. But you are not that way anymore. With every
choice you make, you prove yourself to possess a kind heart.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I guess I had a good teacher.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: You were a good student.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b> and <b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: [laugh]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: [angrily] Are you saying I <i>wasn't</i> a good teacher?

</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: You really want to do this here in the hallway in front of everyone?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Up to you.

Greatest and Powerfullest Student! If a seven-scale mockup doesn't
convince you, I don't know what will.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Where's the Memory Stone? You turned my
friends against me just because I wouldn't put you in the yearbook as
the Greatest and Powerfullest?! "Powerfullest" isn't even a word!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: What are you talking about?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: It's not a word!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: No. What Memory Stone?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: The one you used to erase everyone's memory, you manipulative... blowhard!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: A stone that could make everyone forget
 all the bad tricks I've done...? Which is no tricks. Your puny rock
pales in comparison to the Great and Powerful Trixie!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I don't believe it. You have no idea what I'm talking about.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: I... don't. Sorry.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [groans]
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: Did somebody really erase everyone's memories of you?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Mm-hmm.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: And even though we all know you're the Biggest Meanie, you're saying you're not mean anymore?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: It's complicated.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: So you have this idea of who you're supposed to be, but no one at school sees you that way. Is that it? Trust me. I get it.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Ha. I can't believe the only person who believes me is the one I called a manipulative blowhard. Sorry.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: I took it as a compliment. Let me help you find the Stone.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: What's in it for you?
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: No way. Absolutely not!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: Well, if you'd rather go on being the Biggest Meanie, that's fine by me.

 say how to get your memories back. [gasps, reading] "Perhaps if I had
destroyed the Stone right away, some of my memories could have returned.

it is erased forever."

pulling a rabbit out of a hat, and I do that all the time. Let's talk
motive. Who here hates you enough to erase everyone's good memories of
you?

</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: [munching] Speak for yourself. Mmm, thanks. Word around school is you know a lot about erasing memory.
</dd><dd><b>Micro Chips</b>: I erased a ton of memory just this morning.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: You did?!
</dd><dd><b>Micro Chips</b>: Four terabytes of quantel-accelerflex memory to be precise.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Micro Chips</b>: How come no one's ever impressed by that?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Is there anything you can tell us about it? Anything at all?
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] I can't tell much from a drawing.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Okay.
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] Only that it's felsic-intrusive
igneous, granular in texture, most likely arranged in an equigranular
matrix, with scattered biotite mica and amphibole, at least sixty-five
percent alkali feldspar by volume, with a melting point of twelve-fifty
centigrade, plus or minus ten degrees. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.

</dd><dd><b>Wallflower Blush</b>: I'm right here, you know.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: Uh, who are you?
</dd><dd><b>Wallflower Blush</b>: Wallfower. I've known <i>you</i> since third grade.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: Ahh! I remember third grade. Not you
specifically, but what a grade it was. The Great and Powerful Trrrrixie
debuted her disappearing frog trick. You know, a lot of people don't
realize how much work goes into raising tadpoles. You really have to
coddle them... [trails off]

</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Can I ask a silly question, Wallflower? Where did you take that lovely photograph?
</dd><dd><b>Wallflower Blush</b>: Oh. That's my garden. Well, the
school's garden, technically. I'm the president of the Gardening Club. I
 founded it, too. I'm also the only member. And the only one who's ever
been to the garden. Or seen it. Or even asked about it.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: You're not really into other people, huh?
</dd><dd><b>Wallflower Blush</b>: I was maybe going to add this picture somewhere in the yearbook. What do you think?
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: Sorry. Sunset doesn't let anyone put things in her yearbook. No matter how much they deserve them.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: No! You should do that, Wallflower. Uh, so don't let us keep you from working on it.

wrong thing, literally <i>any</i> public speaking...
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I've had plenty of awkward moments I wish I could erase, too.
</dd><dd><b>Wallflower Blush</b>: But it's no excuse. I was so used to erasing memories that I got completely carried away. I'm sorry for everything.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: It's okay. I'm sorry, too. I may have
stopped being mean, but a Great and Powerful friend helped me realize I
still wasn't very nice to you. Everyone matters, Wallflower. No matter
