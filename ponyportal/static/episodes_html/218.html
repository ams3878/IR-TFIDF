<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: [sighs] I just wanted everything to be perfect. I mean, this was a big deal. But when Discord insists on being involved...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Discord</b>: Regardless of what Spike might say, that little
dragon begged me to help. And let me tell you, he can cause plenty of
chaos all on his purple lonesome.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: I pride myself on baking under pressure, but I just... Oh, dear...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: You'd think we would be used to stuff like this in Ponyville.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I still have nightmares.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: It seemed simple when it started...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: [gasps] It's beautiful!
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup. Nope!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I'm not gonna eat it!
</dd><dd>[poof!]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Eat what? What is it! I want to see!
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Nope!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Why not?!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Because you have a big mouth.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Me?! I keep tons of secrets! Like Fluttershy's
secret fear of clowns. Or that time I caught Twilight sleep-trotting
through town. Oh! And did you know that Octavia went on a date with Bulk
 Biceps? [chuckles] Talk about an odd couple. I heard that— Oh. All
right. Point taken. But we're pals, right? Comrades. Amigos. <i>Come on!</i>
</dd><dd>[dreamy music]

<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: Of course Big Mac asked me to help with his proposal. I'm the most romantic dragon I know.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Discord</b>: [sighs] It really is a curse having infinite powers. Everypony is always asking you to move a couch or help with a proposal.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: Spill it! Every detail! Don't leave anything out!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Ugh. Do we have to hear all the details? Is that like a "friend" thing?
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: [sighs] Eeyup.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [snaps]
</dd><dd>[poof!]
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: I don't talk much, so I want to <i>show</i> Sugar Belle how committed I am. First...
</dd><dd>[wood clattering]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [gasps] You're making a picnic table that matches
 the shelf you made Sugar Belle for her shop when you had a crush on
her, and you're setting up a romantic meal overlooking Sweet Apple
Acres?
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Uh, how did you figure that out?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: If you were a hopeless romantic, you'd know that was the only logical choice.
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Then...
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: You painted apples to leave around Ponyville with little riddles tied to the stem that will lead her up here to meet you?
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Seriously?!
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Now...
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Yuh—
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: I know! You need a giant rhino named Dolores who can knit a romantic sweater for two!
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Uhhh... nope.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [snaps]
</dd><dd>[poof!]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Come on. He needs food for the picnic. That was a gimme.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: I do not get this game.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Okay. You finish your table, I'll pick up whatever you need to eat, and Discord will put all the apples in place.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: I will?
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [snaps]
</dd><dd>[poof!]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[poof!]

</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [reading] "From the Sugarcube Corner, look for
your next clue. Red, delicious, sweet like you. Find it; you'll know
what to do." [groans] He should stick to bucking apples.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Sugar Belle's gonna love it!
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I'll get the food. How long will it take you to place all the apples?
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [snaps]
</dd><dd>[poof!]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Are you sure you put them in the right spots?
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Those terrible riddles on the apples were very clear on the location. I'm sure that they were placed properly.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: I-I-I think. Maybe. Does it matter?
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Oh, okay, fine! I'll double-check.
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: She didn't see the apple! What are we gonna do?
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Well, we could just <i>give</i> it to her.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: That's not romantic! She needs to discover it!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Don't be such a drama dragon. I've precipitated
 liquid cocoa on Equestria and herded long-limbed Leporidae. I can
certainly make a pony see an apple. [snaps]
</dd><dd>[poof!]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [sighs]

<dl><dd>[oven timer dings]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Hey, Mrs. Cake. I need to pick up a few things.
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: Oh, I'm afraid you'll have to wait. I'm a bit busy at the moment. Oh. Is this sour cream or sweet cream?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh, it's kind of important. Maybe I could take some of these off your hooves?
</dd><dd>[smack!]
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: No! Those are for... something important, too!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: All of them? There's... one, two, three, four—
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: Twenty-one! And yes, all of them!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Who needs twenty-one desserts?
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: I can't tell you! It's a secret! Come by later.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Later won't work.
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: Why not?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I can't tell you. It's a secret.
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: [muttering]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [gags] Ugh! Did somepony else bake these?
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: No. Why?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: No reason.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[poof!]

</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Shhh.
</dd><dd>[poof!]
</dd><dd><b>Sugar Belle</b>: Thank you! These are perfect!

</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [sighs] I just have to say, Big Mac is really lucky to have me as a friend.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: Okay... One down, twenty to go. Then I can help you.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Maybe <i>I</i> can help <i>you</i>. Delivering
parchments is my thing. A little dragon breath and fwoosh! We deliver
each scroll into each dessert. Then you can help <i>me</i>. Watch!

</dd><dd>[ponies screaming]

</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: You know, thinking back, I probably could have been clearer which pony to deliver the messages to.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: You think?
</dd><dd>[apples chittering]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [snaps]
</dd><dd>[poof!]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: I sent them back to Sweet Apple Acres. Apples are <i>terrible</i> at taking directions. Couldn't even manage to stay in one location. Now, bananas... [chuckles] ...are much better at listening.
</dd><dd><b>Sugar Belle</b>: What's going on?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Apples running everywhere, and she didn't see the poem to get to the hilltop?!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Getting her to the hilltop is easy, and not seeing the poems is actually a blessing when you think about it. [snaps]

<dl><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: Why would you think sending flaming messages into my desserts would work?! You've ruined all of them!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: To be honest, I tasted some, and burning them might have been an improvement.
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: What?! I never!
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Spike?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Aah! Uh, hey there, Big Mac. Heh. I bet you're wondering what—
</dd><dd>[poof!]
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Sugar Belle!
</dd><dd><b>Sugar Belle</b>: Big Mac?
</dd><dd>[poof!]
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Discord!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Mrs. Cake!
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: What did I do?!
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Nothing. I thought we were just saying each other's names.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I guess this can't get any worse.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: As the Lord of Chaos, I'd advise against saying things like that.
</dd><dd><b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b> and <b>Granny Smith</b>: [screaming]

<dl><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: We have a bit of a reputation for gettin' carried away.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Especially when romance is involved. Heh.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: But that wasn't the case with this. We were just helping Sugar Belle with <i>her</i> plan.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sugar Belle</b>: And the last one should just say "Eeyup!"
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: [muttering] Three tablespoons... So, you're saying you want to put each one of those inside a dessert?
</dd><dd><b>Sugar Belle</b>: Well, since Big Mac's plan to send me a
Hearts and Hooves Day pie with a message inside didn't go so well, I
thought it'd be fun to do it right.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Awww! That's so romantic!
</dd><dd><b>Sugar Belle</b>: He's a pony of few words. I love that about
 him. So, I thought I'd use as many words as possible to propose to him!
 All he has to say is—
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: [imitates Big McIntosh] Eeyup! [giggles, normally] I can't wait for you to be a part of the family!
</dd><dd><b>Sugar Belle</b>: You three played such a big part in Big Mac and I getting together. I'm glad you could help with this.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [reading]
"I-love-you-Big-Mac-would-you-like-to-spend-the-rest-of-our-lives-together-I-hope-you-say-eeyup!"
 And each word has to go into a dessert? That's... one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven... Whoa!
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: Twenty-one! I know!
</dd><dd><b>Sugar Belle</b>: Actually, it's twenty-two. Mrs. Cake was
kind enough to help me bake all the apple-flavored treats I made to get
Big Mac to visit me in my old shop. <i>That</i> one has the invitation for <i>him</i> to come here.
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: Oh, it's... it's no bother! I do love a challenge! Did I add the sugar to this one or to that one?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I think I've seen her add sugar to that bowl six times so far.
</dd><dd><b>Sugar Belle</b>: Now you three go deliver that pie. I have to get some flowers to spruce the place up.

</dd><dd><b>Sugar Belle</b>: [gasps]

</dd><dd><b>Sugar Belle</b>: Uh-oh. Spike and Discord are outside. If
they figure out what we're up to, they'll spill the beans! And I want
this to be a surprise!
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I don't think they suspect anything.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Why would they suspect that we're holding an invitation pie and that Mrs. Cake is baking a twenty-one-dessert proposal?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: <i><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">I can't believe I'm gonna have a sister-in-law!</span></i> [echoing]
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b> and <b>Scootaloo</b>: Shhhhhh!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: This is our shot to make up for all the trouble we caused when Big Mac first asked Sugar Belle out!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: We can't give away the surprise! You need to play it cool!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Right, right. Uh, how's this?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Better?

</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Maybe we should wait here for him. He's bound to show up soon.

</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: That's nice, Granny, but we really need to find Big Mac, so—
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: It was about Grand Pear. Only it wasn't. We were in outer space on some kinda mission to explore a strange new world.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: If we get stuck listening to Granny, we'll never find Big Mac.
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: And Mudbriar was there, bein' as logical
as ever, but his ears was all pointy-like. And then Discord showed up
and... well, you know, he was pretty much the same.

</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Hey! Those desserts were ruined way before I ruined them!
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: They were not! Well, I... may have mixed up a... a few ingredients. It was such a rush.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: You should both be very disappointed in yourselves.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: What about you and your apple monster?!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Yes, but you all expect that of me.

</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Okay, this time, it really wasn't me!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: I shouldn't have taken all those desserts at
once. It's just, how can you say no to such a sweet idea? Oh! Ha!
"Sweet"! [laughs] I made a joke.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: In retrospect, dragon flame and baked goods aren't the best combo.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: We felt like it was all our fault.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Except for the apple monster. That was
Discord. And Mrs. Cake messing up those recipes. And Spike burning the
messed-up recipes. And—
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: The point is we all felt bad for ruining Big Mac and Sugar Belle's proposals.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: It was all green, and then Grand Pear
looked at me all dramatical and says, "Where nopony has gone before!"
And whoosh! Away we flew!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sugar Belle</b>: Today was... interesting.
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup.
</dd><dd><b>Sugar Belle</b>: You okay?
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: I... I'm sorry, Sugar Belle. I wanted
everything to go right today. I wanted our love to be as perfect as my
parents' was when they planted these two trees together. Instead, it
turned into a mess. Just like when I asked you out. Just like Hearts and
 Hooves Day. No matter how hard I try, I always seem to mess up when it
comes to you.
</dd><dd><b>Sugar Belle</b>: I think you've got things backwards.
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: What do you mean?
</dd><dd><b>Sugar Belle</b>: From everything you told me about your
parents, they had to deal with things a lot tougher than some burnt
desserts and an apple monster.
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: I.... guess that's true.
</dd><dd><b>Sugar Belle</b>: This apple tree and pear tree are stronger
together. They'll survive whatever comes because they don't have to do
it alone. They belong together. Like your parents. And like us.
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup.
</dd><dd><b>Sugar Belle</b>: Today was a disaster. But today was also
the last day we're ever gonna have to do anything apart. From here on
out, we'll be together. And we'll make sure everything always works out
just right.
