</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: C'mon, Fluttershy! Cider season's about to start!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [squee] [shrieks] Oh, where are we? What's the rush?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: The rush? Don't you remember what happened last year? Or the year before that? Or pretty much any cider season ever?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, well, uh–
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: <i>Pinkie Pie</i>. She always ends up ahead of us in line, and then they always run out of cider!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I guess I–
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, not this year! This year I'm gonna
get there before sunrise, so I can drink all the cider I want and laugh
when she doesn't get any! It's the perfect plan. Y'know, I might even
buy some cider and hold onto it for a while, drinking it drop by drop in
 front of her– [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Gee, Rainbow Dash. It looks like a few other ponies had the same idea.
</dd><dd>[zipping noise]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, gosh, Pinkie. I love your new style.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Who <i>are</i> all these ponies?!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Isn't this great? I couldn't sleep last
night 'cause I was so excited about cider season, and I had this
brilliant idea to come down here and camp out, so I told a few others
about it, and they all thought it was a great idea too, and now it's
just a big old cider party! Woo-hoo! Oh, gosh, that's a lot of ponies.
Hope they don't run out before you get any.

</dd><dd><b>Ponies</b>: ["Yeah", general complaining]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hold on, everypony. We've done our best to improve supply this year-
</dd><dd><b>Caramel</b>: You <i>always</i> say that!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: And it's always true. But Apple family cider
is made with love and integrity, and only the highest quality apples in
Equestria. Sorry, but that recipe takes time.
</dd><dd><b>Ponies</b>: [more complaining]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: If y'all just be patient, we'll have plenty more tomorrow.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: She's right, y'know! You can't rush perfection! And this year's batch was <i>per</i>fection!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Uh, Pinkie Pie–

</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: But if it really does work, we could make everypony in town happy!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I just don't know, y'all. We've always made cider the same way.
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup. Huh?
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: We'll sweeten the deal. You supply the apples...
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: ...We supply the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000.
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b> and <b>Flam</b>: Then we split those sweet sweet profits...
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: ...Seventy-five...

</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: And, we'll throw in the magic to power the machine for free.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Cider sales keep our business afloat through the winter. We'd lose Sweet Apple Acres if we agreed to this.
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b> and <b>Flam</b>: So? What'll it be?
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: No deal.
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: Hmph. Very well. If you refuse our generous offer to be partners, then we'll just have to be competitors.

 in Equestria. We'll find some others and make more cider than all of

</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Tomorrow mornin', right here!
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: But I'm afraid we haven't any... [spits] ...apples.
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: You can use our south field! It'll be worth it to teach y'all a thing or two about cider making!
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: Excellent; we have a bet. Whoever produces the most barrels in one hour wins the exclusive right to sell cider in Ponyville.
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: And after we beat ya, I don't never want to see you bambahoozlers around here again!

</dd><dd><i>I wanted to share my thoughts with you. </i>[clears throat]<i>
 I didn't learn anythin'! Ha! I was right all along! If you take your
time to do things the right way, your work will speak for itself. Sure I
 could tell you I learned something about how my friends are always
there to help me, and I can count on them no matter what, but truth is, I
 knew that already too.</i>
