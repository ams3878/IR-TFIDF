<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: Okay, Spike. You know you might get distracted by
the stacks of books and copious charts, so remember what to say.
"Twilight, I know you're in full prep mode for Trivia Trot tomorrow, but
 you need to get some sleep!" Huh. [laughs] Nice work. You got this.
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [gasps] This is weird.
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Twilight! What are you doing?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Great question, Spike! And the answer is...
</dd><dd>[bell rings]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: ...going to bed! Brains need eight hours of sleep to perform at optimum levels!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh. Cool. I thought I'd have to force you to go
to bed since tomorrow is your chance to be the first pony to win
Ponyville Trivia three times in a row. That is tomorrow, right?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The answer is...
</dd><dd>[bell rings]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: ...yes! Ask me another one.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Another what?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Another question! I want to stay in
the zone. That way, I can sleep in the zone! Wake up in the zone! And be
 totally in the zone tomorrow!
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Uh, this is a whole new level of "Twilight-ing", isn't it? Heh.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The answer is...
</dd><dd>[bell rings]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: ...yes!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Are you okay?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The answer is...
</dd><dd>[bell rings]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: ...<i>yes!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Well, good night, Twilight. Good luck with your brain sleep and getting that third win. [chuckles]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The answer is...
</dd><dd>[bell rings]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: ...good night! And yes!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: That wasn't a question.

<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm glad you decided to come watch your first Trivia Trot, Spike. I hope the rules aren't too confusing.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Rules? Isn't trivia just asking questions and answering them?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [laughs] The Trot is a little more
involved than that. Let's start with the first category of rules.
[reading] "Categories. Rule one: Each category must be categorically
designated and thoroughly researched in all categorical..."
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: "...participating in Trivia Trot." And
that wraps up rule forty-one point six. Of course, the exception to that
 – rule forty-one point six A – is interesting itself because—
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh, look! We're here!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ooh! I can't wait to see who my partner's gonna be!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: You don't get to pick your own team?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Rule twenty point one six B, Spike. To keep things fair, the teams are randomly selected.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [sarcastically] Twenty point one six B. How could I forget?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And based on the regular attendees,
I've charted every potential teammate's strengths and weaknesses, plus
my percentage of winning with each one!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Ha! I knew there'd be a chart! Glad I'm just
watching. I don't think I could handle being your teammate. What if I
let you down?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [laughs] You could never let me down,
Spike. But I'm glad you're watching, too. I'm going to need all the
support I can get for win number three!
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd>[indistinct conversations]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, well, well, if it ain't our reignin' champ. Think you can win again this week, Twilight?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Everypony here has a different area of expertise, so it really is anypony's game. But yes!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Then you better hope you get paired with me, because I am gonna rule this game!
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Sunburst</b>: We'll just see about that! I didn't come all
the way from the Crystal Empire to lose. And I hope you realize I have
the highest percentage of correct answers, and I aim to keep it that
way.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [whickers] I hope <i>you</i> realize not every category is gonna be "Spells So Old, Not Even Star Swirl the Bearded Remembers Them".
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I hope there's one on fur maintenance for adorable creatures, because I've been 'brushing up'. [giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Angel</b>: [chitters angrily]
</dd><dd><b>Mudbriar</b>: Technically, that was a category last week.
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: It won't be in the game tonight.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Rule thirty-seven point two C. No back-to-back categories. But I think Fluttershy was joking.
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Sure sounded like a joke to me! [giggles] Woo-hoo!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie Pie?!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Present!
</dd><dd>[dramatic musical sting]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [panicked muttering]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: What's wrong, Twilight?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I hadn't anticipated Pinkie Pie as a
potential player! She's never played before! My chart is completely off!
 I have no way to predict what'll happen, and unpredictable is not good
for a Trivia Trot three-peat!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Do I have to do that thing where I list all your
successes as Princess of Friendship to put things into perspective and
remind you this is just a game?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike! This has nothing to do with being the Princess of Friendship! And this is <i>not</i> just a game! This! Is! <i>Trivia Trot!</i>
</dd><dd>[tapping]
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Okay, settle down, everypony. I'm fixin' to pick these here teams.
</dd><dd>[crowd cheers]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps] It's starting! I have to reevaluate my chart! Spike, I need you to find the part on matchups! Can you look outside?
</dd><dd>[teleportation zap]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: What'd I miss?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Granny's about to call out the fifth
team. Sunburst gave me the highest chance of winning, but he's been
paired with Cranky Doodle!
</dd><dd><b>Cranky Doodle Donkey</b>: [mumbles, muttering] What? Who's that?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: At least Rainbow Dash and Applejack aren't together. Team Apple-Dash is basically unstoppable.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [growls]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [growls]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And apart they'll spend all their energy trying to one-up each other, so that only helps my chances.
</dd><dd><b>Bulk Biceps</b>: <i>Let's do this! Yeah!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Eh, not every team is a threat, but there aren't many ponies left.
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: All righty, hold on to your horseshoes, 'cause the next pair of players is... Maud and Mudbriar!
</dd><dd>[crowd groans]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: What's wrong?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Maud and Mudbriar have been paired
together every week. It's a statistical improbability! Which would be
fine if they weren't so good.
</dd><dd>[sizzling]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [deep gasp] Oh, no! According to my calculations, the only pony who could really threaten my winning streak is...!
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: And our final pair of contestants for this week's Trivia Trot is... Twilight and Pinkie Pie!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Twilight! It's you and me! Isn't that great?
</dd><dd>[clatter]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah. Great.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: So, I'm guessing the one pony who could mess up your winning streak is Pinkie?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Twilight! I can't believe we're partners for a game! I love games! And I'm super duper excited for <i>this</i> game because it'll be my first time ever playing, and I get to play with you, which makes it even funner!
</dd><dd>[zip!]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Twilight and Pinkie Pie forever! Ooh! We
could be Team Twinkie! Or [gasps] Team Pink-Light! [gasps] Sparkle Pie!
No-no-no-no! [gasps] Twi-Pie! [squee]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie, I'm glad you're excited, but
tonight's game is special. I could be the first pony ever to win three
consecutive Trots in a row. And I'm really hoping I do.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You don't have anything to worry about. I'll do everything I can to be the bestest and most funnest teammate ever.
</dd><dd>[bell ringing]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: So... still think you can win?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [exhales] I know I can. Pinkie might
not be the partner I expected, but I can coach her along. And besides,
I'm pretty good at this game. If she misses a few, I'm sure I can pick
up the slack.
</dd><dd>[airhorn blows]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Let's get this party started!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [laughs nervously]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Now, the first order of business is we need somepony to keep score.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I'll do it!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [laughs] I'm not sure you wanna take that job, Spike. The score-keepin' can get a mite intense.
</dd><dd><b>Sunburst</b>: Yeah. Starlight used to do it, but now... Well, I can't even say the word "trivia" around her.
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: [scoffs] Apple mash. Don't let them scare ya. You'll be fine. Now, let the games begin!

<dl><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: The first category is "Literary Figures".

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ooh! A category about books! We're off to a great start!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: [clears throat] Who is the pony that despises the holiday season in the old classic <i>A Hearth's Warmin' Tale</i>?
</dd><dd>[bell rings]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: The answer is nopony! Because everypony ends up loving the holiday with singing, festive cakes, and thoughtful presents!

</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Just doing my job, Twilight.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sighs]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Sorry. I didn't know we could have negative points.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's fine, Pinkie. But maybe it'll help our chances if I coach you as we go. Tip one – try sitting still.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Can do, Coach Twilight—
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And don't get distracted. Or <i>be</i> distracting. Oh, and remember to listen carefully. Also, it's best to keep quiet between questions.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Got it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [whimpers] Sitting still, sitting still, sitting still...! [continues under]
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Which topographical locale used to be a cavern, but after thousands of years of erosion, is now a gorge?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: What?!
</dd><dd>[bell rings]
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: The answer is the Ghastly Gorge.
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: That is one hundred percent correct!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [chomp]
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: The next category is "Apples"!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Rigged!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I didn't hear <i>you</i> complain when the category was "Wonderbolt History".
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: But... [stutters] that-that's totally different!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Okay, Pinkie. Remember, the category is "Apples". Keep your mind on apples.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Apples, apples, apples, apples... Ooh, and oranges. And grapes! And strawberries. [gasps] Strawberry cupcakes! I'm hungry.
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Which variety of apple only blooms for five days?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [coughs] Don't choke. [whistles]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Now, why would I choke on a question about apples? Uh... What was the question again?
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: You kiddin' me?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Come on, Pinkie, you know this one. Mysterious apples? Only around for five days?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd>[stomach growls]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Quiet down there. Pretty sure there's a rule against tummies ringing in.
</dd><dd>[bell rings]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, I'm just guessing, but is it zap apples?
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Finally! Yes, Fluttershy, it is. At least <i>somepony</i> here knows her apples.
</dd><dd><b>Bulk Biceps</b>: Yeah!
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [weak laugh]
</dd><dd>[stomach growls]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: One minute left in the refreshment/bathroom break—! Aah!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike! I don't think I can coach
Pinkie well enough for us to get my three-peat! I don't want her to feel
 bad! She's trying so hard, but I might have to start answering
everything myself!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Look, Twilight! No more belly growl interruptions for Team Twi-Pie! [chomps, gulps]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Maybe instead of focusing on Pinkie, you should just focus on how <i>you're</i> playing.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Or... I should look at how everypony else is playing.
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Hope you're all in your seats 'cause the
break is over, and it is time for more questions. [muttering] Let me
see, uh... How do you say "reward" in Olde Ponish?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd>[smack!]
</dd><dd>[bell rings]
</dd><dd><b>Cranky Doodle Donkey</b>: [snoring]

</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Correct!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Sleeping!</i>
</dd><dd>[crowd muttering]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [clears throat] Sunburst's partner is
sleeping. And according to rule fifty-seven point six, sleeping on the
table is subject to dis-qual-i-fi-ca-tion!
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Oh, looky here. That's an actual rule.
Cranky is disqualified. I'm sorry, Sunburst. Without your teammate, you
can't play neither.
</dd><dd><b>Sunburst</b>: Aw, fine! But I'm counting that as a correct answer! [groans] Can't even stay awake for five minutes...
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Don't worry, Pinkie. We're not out of this game yet.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Angel</b>: [whispering]

<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Motion to establish new rule! No expressionless contestants!
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Nice try.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Fine.
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: The next category is... "Cupcakes"!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] Twilight! I know all about those! You have to let me help!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [exhales heavily] Suuuure! Just when
we're finally back in the game! [laughs crazily] Why, that sounds
perfect, Pinkie, but... Ooh! Isn't that a confetti appreciation parade I
 see?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Where?!
</dd><dd>[zip!]
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: What flavor cupcakes did Princess Celestia order for Princess Luna's surprise birthday party last year?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Wait, what?!
</dd><dd>[bell rings]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Double midnight chocolate fudge with chili pepper frosting!
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Correct!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hey! I knew that! I made those cupcakes!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Sorry, Pinkie. But you were looking at the parade, and I didn't want our team to miss out on the point.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I guess that makes sense, but which way did that confetti parade go anyway?

<dl><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: The category is "Sticks and Stones".
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [brays] I don't know anything about those! That's not any kind of category!
</dd><dd><b>Mudbriar</b>: Technically, it's a kind of category where <i>we</i> know the answers and <i>you</i> don't.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [hyperventilating]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Don't worry, fellow Twi-Pie. I grew up on a rock farm. I'm sure I know some of these.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [hyperventilating faster]
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: What kind of stone can be used to start a fire?
</dd><dd>[bell rings]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: The black one!
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: The answer is flint.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yeah, that one! We both get points, right?
</dd><dd><b>Sunburst</b>: Sorry, Pinkie. Rule four – answers must be specific and exact. I'd help you if I could. I know this category pretty well.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Gee, Pinkie! I forgot the name of that famous rock in Griffonstone. Could you ask Maud?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You got it! Hey, Maud! What's the name of the famous rock in Griffonstone?
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: Pinkie, you can't ask me that.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Sure I can. I just did.
</dd><dd>[crowd muttering]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: What?
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: You can't go and ask another player about
rocks when that's the category. It's in the rulebook. Where's... Sorry,
Pinkie, but you're disqualified.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: What?!
</dd><dd>[loud thud]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I-I can't believe I'm disqualified! [whines]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [laughs nervously] I'm sorry, Pinkie. Guess I forgot about that rule.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh, no! If I'm out, you don't have a partner! You won't be able to get your third win!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Actually, since there's another player who has also had his teammate disqualified...
</dd><dd><b>Sunburst</b>: Rule nineteen point seven B, whereby players whose teammates were disqualified may form a new team.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh. Okay. Um, I'll just cheer you on from... over there.
</dd><dd>[balloons deflate]
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: The next category is "Ancient Legends".
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, we're gonna crush this round!
</dd><dd><b>Sunburst</b>: I don't know, Twilight. You seem out of the zone today. But don't worry. I can pick up the slack.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What?! I am the reigning Trot champ! If there's any slack that needs picking, I'll be the up! I mean, wait...
</dd><dd><b>Sunburst</b>: I'm just saying you seem a little frazzled, and I do have a correct answer percentage to maintain.
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Who traveled to Equestria from a distant land seeking to steal the magic from its pony inhabitants?
</dd><dd>[bell rings]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That would be Lord Tirek!
</dd><dd>[bell rings]
</dd><dd><b>Mudbriar</b>: Technically, that answer is incomplete. The answer is Lord Tirek <i>and</i> Scorpan.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But Scorpan tried to convince Tirek <i>not</i> to do it, so technically he wasn't part of it, even if he started out—! [groans] Never mind.

</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: How many holes are there in Daring Do's hat?

</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Twenty!
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Correct!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ha!
</dd><dd><b>Sunburst</b>: Twilight, I knew that one! You just cost us a point <i>and</i> the correct answer I needed to boost my percentage!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, I knew it, too. You're not the only pony to ever read a book, you know?
</dd><dd><b>Sunburst</b>: You're right, Twilight. I'm sorry. But now
that I think about it, I'm not so sure about Dash's answer. Could you do
 a quick fact check?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, I know it's twenty. But if you
want proof... Wait! According to rule eighteen point three, I can't
check outside reference material.
</dd><dd>[teleportation zap]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps] Are you trying to get me disqualified?! What kind of pony would do that to their own teammate?!
</dd><dd><b>Sunburst</b>: You're right, Twilight. I don't know what got
into me. I was so focused on my correct answers, I wasn't thinking
straight. Can you forgive me?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's okay, Sunburst. I understand. And
 I have a teammate of my own to apologize to. Lucky for you, Cranky's
awake. And according to rule fifty-seven point six B...
</dd><dd><b>Sunburst</b>: Players previously disqualified for sleeping may rejoin the game. Provided they're well-rested.
</dd><dd><b>Cranky Doodle Donkey</b>: [mutters] Where am I? What time is it? Where are my morning haycakes?!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie, you were the best teammate I could ask for, but I let wanting to win keep me from seeing that.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [scoffs] I knew you wanted to win, but I probably could have helped a little. And even if I couldn't...
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: ...we still could've had fun. I'm so
sorry for not realizing it. I got so obsessed with one thing, I forgot
what really mattered.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [sarcastically] No! That doesn't sound like you at all!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, win or lose, nothing is more important than my friend. Or my team. Twi-Pie forever?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I-I don't know.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I understand. I guess even the Princess of Friendship can mess things up with her friends.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh, it's not that. It's  just that I already
 changed it to Team Twi-Burst, and now I guess I should change it to
Sun-Doodle? [chomps]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Actually, I have a better idea.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: According to rule thirteen point two, players can join the game at any time, provided they start from zero.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Wow. These rules are really convoluted. But doesn't starting from zero mean we'll lose?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, our chances aren't good, but the odds of having fun on Team Twi-Pie are one hundred percent!
