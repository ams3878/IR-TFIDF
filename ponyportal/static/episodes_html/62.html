<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I <i>love</i> it when Princess Celestia comes to Ponyville! I got my hooves shined just like Rarity for the occasion. Ya like?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I certainly do!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm surprised she's not here yet.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [sighs] I wonder what's taking so long?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And where are Applejack and Fluttershy?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Fluttershy's detained helping Applejack with a mishap at Sweet Apple Acres. They'll be along.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: But, I still don't get why the Princess would be so late.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: She's bringing an important visitor. That could be part of it.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: A visitor who's important and <i>slow</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: <i>Maybe</i> it's somepony so terribly important, she still had many more terribly important things to do before she got here.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [gasp] Maybe the visitor has a deer antler, a goat leg, a bat wing, and a snake tail!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah, right. That's Discord.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Why in the wide, wide world of Equestria would Princess Celestia bring along someone like <i>that</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: M-m-maybe you should ask... <i>her</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Huh?

<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: With all due respect, Princess Celestia, <i>how could you bring Discord here</i>?! [clears throat] Your majesty.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: I'm fully aware that the last time Discord was here, he created serious havoc.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: If by "serious havoc" you mean "turning Ponyville into the chaos capital of the world"...
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: ...<i>and</i> tricking us all into being the opposite of our true selves...
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>And</i> making yummy delicious chocolate
milk rain all over the place without a single dollop of whipped cream to
 go with it anywhere in sight! <i>Not a single dollop</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Yes, I understand. But I have use for
 Discord's magic if it can be reformed to serve good instead of evil.
This is why I've brought Discord here, because I believe that you are
the ponies who can help him do just that.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: This will never work! This is a disaster! How will we ever control him?! We're doomed!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Need I remind you that <i>you</i> are the ponies who turned him back into stone like this in the first place?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I suppose we can just use the Elements of Harmony against him again if it gets out of hand.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Uh, w-w-we probably need a volunteer to run away from here right away to get them. I'll do it!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: No need, Spike. I have them right
here, and I've cast a spell so Discord can't take them and hide them
again. Now where is Fluttershy? I believe she may know best how to begin
 reforming Discord.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: <i>Fluttershy</i>? Really?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[beaver chittering]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: What's he goin' on about now?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Good news. Mr. Beaverton Beaverteeth has agreed to take his dam apart and move it.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, it's about time. My apple trees are so waterlogged, I can practically hear 'em gargle!
</dd><dd>[beaver loudly complaining]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: But he says first you'll have to apologize for calling him "a nuisance".
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: <i>Apologize</i>? He's lucky I didn't call him a <i>varmint</i>!
</dd><dd>[beaver loudly complaining]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [gasps] Mr. Beaverton Beaverteeth! Such language!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Fine, fine. I apologize.
</dd><dd>[beaver blowing raspberry]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [growls]
</dd><dd>[logs tumbling]
</dd><dd>[splash]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [sighs] Thanks, Fluttershy. Don't know what I would've done without you.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Glad I could help.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hey, slackers! Double time it on over to Ponyville, would ya?! We're all waiting on you!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: I realize that this is a tall order,
but I wouldn't ask if I weren't confident you could get him to use magic
 obediently of his own free will.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: And... you really think I'll know best how to do that?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: I do. Now, I must return to Canterlot for Equestria's royal summit. You may release Discord when ready.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Okay, ponies, guess it's time to get started. Let's just hope this releasing spell works.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Or... let's not.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We'd best keep our elements on at all times 'til further notice.
</dd><dd><b>Rest of main cast</b>: Check!
</dd><dd>[magical warbling]
</dd><dd>[rock cracking]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [screaming] [yawns] Oh! Ooh! Ooooh! Well, it's
about time somepony got me out of that prison block. What a relief!
[snaps fingers]
</dd><dd>[twig snaps]
</dd><dd><b>Main cast</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What do you think you're doing?!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Nnnnnnnnngh– Why, stretching, of course. When
you're a creature of chaos, stone bodysuits aren't your typical go-to
fashion choice. Nnngh... [snaps fingers]
</dd><dd>[discorded bunny screeches]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] Make that bunny cute again! Now!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Oh... [sniggers] He's adorable the way he is.
</dd><dd>[bunny chomps]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [blows raspberry] You know what else is
adorable? You ponies truly believe that you can reform me, and that
you're putting your faith in this one here to make it happen. Makes me
wanna pinch your little horsey cheeks...
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: How'd you know about that?!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Being turned to stone doesn't keep me from
hearing every word Celestia says. Although I admit it makes rolling my
eyes a challenge.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, unless you want us to turn you <i>back</i> to stone, you'll zap those animals back the way they were, pronto!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Oh, you wouldn't dare turn me back to stone and risk disappointing your <i>precious</i> princess.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Try us, "Dip-cord"!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: You think you can treat poor defenseless animals like that and get away with it?!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You go, Fluttershy!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: You'd best watch your step, buster, or I'll give you... <i>the Stare</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [sarcastically] The Stare? Oh no, please, not
that! Anything but your disapproving eyeballs! [laughs] Oh no! No no no,
 stop! No, no! [strangled noises] I can't! Stop! I can't take it
anymore! I'll do whatever you say! Because... [laughs] You are
hilarious! [laughs]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: If it turns out we need to use our elements against you, I'm sure we can convince Princess Celestia it was for a good reason!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Mmm... I suppose that's correct. [snaps fingers]
</dd><dd>[bunny chittering]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [snaps fingers on tail]
</dd><dd>[beavers chittering]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [to audience, under his breath] Oopsie!
[normally] Well, it looks like I know where I'll be crashing while I'm
being "reformed"... With <i>you</i>, Fluttershy. [laughs]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, dear.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: He may be horrible, but that doesn't mean we
have to act the same way. We should at least try to be hospitable. [to
Angel] You don't mind giving up your favorite spot on the couch, do you,
 Angel Bunny?
</dd><dd><b>Angel</b>: [angry squeaking]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, I'm sorry about Angel. Are you alright?
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Oh, yes. Thank you, Fluttershy, for your concern. If only your pony friends could be as considerate...
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Don't listen to him, Fluttershy! He's just trying to drive a wedge between us like he always does.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Now why in the <i>world</i> would I <i>ever</i> try to do a thing like <i>that</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: So we can't unite and use the Elements of Harmony against you, <i>that's</i> why!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: I never thought of that...
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You big liar!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Now, look who's a liar. Anyone can plainly see that I'm not big at all.
</dd><dd>[crash]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Oops. [snaps fingers] There, all better. [cracks tail like a whip]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I can't watch...
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: We'll be outside.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You sure you're okay with this?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I know it's not gonna be easy, but Princess Celestia's counting on me. And... I think I actually know what to do.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You do?
</dd><dd><b>Angel Bunny</b>: [angry squeaking, continues under]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I think the key is to befriend him. Being kind to him and letting him be my house guest is probably the best way to do that.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And you really think that'll work?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I think it's worth a try.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Okay, but if you need us, all you need
 to do is whisper "help", and we'll be back here with our elements. [to
Discord] So watch that goat-legged step of yours, pal!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Wh-what?! Look at me! I'm practically reformed already.
</dd><dd>[door closes]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: She's really alright with him staying there?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That's what she said.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Personally, I think we should come up with a backup plan, in case this whole "befriending" business doesn't work out.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Rainbow Dash is right. This is Discord we are
talking about, girls. It wouldn't be a bad idea to have another trick up
 our sleeves.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And I think I know just the trick.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Discord? Oh, there you are. Listen, Discord, I
 just want to make sure you know that if there's anything I can do to–
uh, umm, are you eating... paper?
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [gulp] Am I? Huh, how odd of me. [chews]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Well, um... I'm just heading out, so you just make yourself at home while I'm gone.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Buh-bye, have a nice time! Everything is fine here. Bye bye... Bye bye...
</dd><dd>[door shuts]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: You like carrots, Angel? I'm playing your owner for a fool! [laughs] How d'ya like <i>them</i> carrots?
</dd><dd><b>Angel</b>: [screams]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [snaps fingers]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[pages turning]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That's weird. The spell I had in mind isn't in here. Spike, where are the other books I asked you to pull?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Right here, Twilight.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I really want to have a reforming spell up and running pronto.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: But what if he makes the Elements of Harmony disappear like he did last time?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Princess Celestia cast a spell protecting them, remember? Uh-oh.
</dd><dd>[books thudding]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: What's wrong?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Princess Celestia didn't cast a spell protecting our books! Everywhere I thought I'd find the reforming spell... [gasps]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[rumbling]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [eating] Are you sure this isn't overdoing it?
You said to make myself at home while you were gone, but I wouldn't want
 to overstep my bounds.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Nngh... I did say that, so... if this makes you more comfortable... by all means, please feel free.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Oh. Well, it does, very much so. You're so very
 kind, my dear Fluttershy. I always knew that you were the understanding
 one, not like those <i>nasty</i> friends of yours.
</dd><dd><b>Angel</b>: [Wilhelm scream]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [gasps] My friends aren't nasty!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Well, of course you'd say that. It just goes to
 show how understanding you truly are. You know, I think Princess
Celestia is right when she singled you out as the one who could reform
me. You're off to such a good start, I'm seriously considering actually <i>being</i> reformed. [under previous: blows raspberry]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Fluttershy! Fluttershy, can you hear me?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Goodness! I hear Twilight!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Fluttershy, what's going on? Are you okay?!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: We're fine. Everything's going great. Isn't it, Angel?
</dd><dd><b>Angel</b>: [chitters dizzily]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We've come to get you away from Discord! He's just terrible and, from the looks of it, completely out of control!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, but you're wrong! We're making great progress!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b> and <b>Spike</b>: <i>Seriously</i>?!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I'm earning his trust by giving him a little space to be himself.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Hate to break it to ya, but he used that "space to be himself" to tear out all the reforming spells from the library!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: That does explain the paper eating...
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: He <i>ate</i> them?! Ugggghhhh!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: But we aren't gonna need a spell. He's already really considering being reformed! He said so.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And you believed him?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: If I'm going to be his friend, I have to
start by giving him the benefit of the doubt! Tell you what. Bring all
the ponies over for a dinner party this evening, and I'll bet his
manners will have really improved by then. I'll even get him to put the
cottage back on the ground first.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sighs] Alright. Dinner it is.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ugh, I can't believe we're having a dinner party with Discord!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: This evening is sure to be a disaster. Glad I didn't bother wearing my fanciest outfit.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Fluttershy thinks this is the way to reform Discord and asked us to give it a chance.
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Oh, our pony guests! [upper class voice] We're so delighted that you've come. Please, do come in.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: See what a beautiful job he did helping? Discord set the entire table himself. I'm so proud.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: May I take your... [clears throat] <i>hats</i>, ladies?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hang on to your elements, girls. It's gonna be a bumpy night.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: As you all know, Princess Celestia hoped we'd help Discord use his magic for good instead of evil.
</dd><dd>[splat]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Pinkie Pie, care for some gravy?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You bet!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Allow me.
</dd><dd>[magic pop]
</dd><dd>[animate gravy boat panting like a dog]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh, what a cute little gravy boat you are! Yes you are! Yes you are!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That's one <i>creepy</i> little gravy boat if you ask me.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, come on now, Dashie. You're not even giving this a chance.
</dd><dd>[pouring]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hey! That's hot!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Whoops! [chuckles] I'm so sorry!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: He did that on purpose!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Oh, well, I don't know about that. Mistakes happen. Oh, look, everypony, dancing candles!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'm not falling for that! Discord's just trying to distract us from–
</dd><dd>[poking noises]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [grunts] Hey! Knock it off! I suppose that's another "mistake"?
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: No, I think you just made them mad.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: There's something fishy going on.
</dd><dd>[splashes]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Discord?
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Well, it's hardly my fault if the soup tureen finds the term "something fishy" to be offensive.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Not the dress! Not the dress!
</dd><dd>[splashes]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: That tureen's only doin' what you're makin' it do!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Now let's not jump to any conclusions.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Fluttershy! Can't you see what he's doing?
 He's playing innocent with you so you'll never agree to use the
Elements of Harmony against him!
</dd><dd>[splash]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Oh, well, that's a bit harsh, isn't it?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You see what I'm saying, right, Fluttershy? Fluttershy!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: You know what I see? I see that Discord's far from perfect, but I also see none of you giving him a chance!
</dd><dd><b>Rest of main cast</b>: [complaints]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What's gotten into you?! Why do you keep cutting him so much slack?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Because that's what friends do.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: We're friends?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Why, of course! I can't remember my house ever being this lively before you came along.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Oh... Well, I've... never really had a friend before.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Well, now you do!
</dd><dd>[window opening]
</dd><dd><b>Angel</b>: [worried chittering]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Now is not a good time, Angel. We're having a dinner party.

</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [gasps] Such language! [sighs] It's no use. They won't listen to a word I say!

</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Fluttershy, oh, there you are. A sight for sore eyes.

</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: It <i>is</i> awful. This is Applejack's

around? You think I'm just going to turn all this back because <i>you</i> say so? Because if I don't, I'll lose the one friend I ever had? [pause] Oh. Oh. Well played, Fluttershy. Well played.

<dl><dd><b>Discord</b>: Yes, Princess, I'm ready to use my magic for good instead of evil. [under his breath] Most of the time.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Congratulations on your success,
ponies. I definitely sense a big change in Discord. [to Twilight] I'll
leave the Elements of Harmony with you, Twilight. Just in case.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You were right when you said
Fluttershy would be the one to find the way to reform Discord. By
treating Discord as a friend, she got him to realize that friendship was
 actually important to him. And something that, once he had, he didn't
want to lose.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Go on. Say it...
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [groans] Alright. [quickly] Friendship is magic.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: See? He can be a real sweetheart once you get to know him.
