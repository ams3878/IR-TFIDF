</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Just one more time? Please?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Alright, but this is the last one.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Woooo!
</dd><dd>[splash]
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: [spluttering] Who done that?!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Sure wish you'd come swim with us, Granny.
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Uh, sorry, dear. I just can't bring myself anywhere near that there swimmin' hole.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: How come?
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Well, I wasn't always this way...
</dd><dd>[telecine beeping]
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Time was, I was an aquapony all-star! In
fact, I was the only Apple to ever come close to breaking the Equestria
high-diving record! Falling six stories into a deep dish pie pan takes a
 toll on the hindquarters. Oh, I was so sore, took years before I could
even <i>look</i> at the water again! Just the idea of swimmin' makes my
whole body ache! Besides, these old legs can't even paddle fast enough
to stay afloat.
</dd><dd>[splash]
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: [panicked noises]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Boy, I sure would hate to be afraid of swimmin'. You think I'll ever be scared of the water?

</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: The best one in Ponyville!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Do you think I could be a high diver?
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Nope.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Absolutely not.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: But–
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Now you hold your horsefeathers, little seed! I never said bein' a high diver was a smart decision! It's incredibly dangerous!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: I know, but–
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: But nothin'! It is the riskiest, scariest,
 darn-fool thing I ever did do! That's not to say I didn't wish I was
still young and spry and confident, but let's leave the flyin' through
the air to the Pegasi.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Wow, when you put it that way, it doesn't sound so fun.

</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: A demonstration of a better time! And if we

</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: A phenomenon? What's that?
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: It's a circumstance perceptible by the senses, but in this case, it's the simple fact that:
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>There's ailments all around us in everything we touch and see
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>[Flam]</b>
<dl><dd>A sickness that lies waiting there in every breath you breathe

</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Flim</b>: Now I understand that some of you don't think you're sick.
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: But twisted hooves and aching joints don't heal all that quick.

</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Flim</b>: It cures the reins, the spurs, and the Clydesdale fur blight.
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: Hooferia and horsentery cured in just a night.
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: You've got swollen hooves and hindquarters or terrible bridle-bit cleft.
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: Saunter sitz and gallop plop will give your tail some heft.
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: Mane loss, hay fever, or terrible tonsillitis.
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: You heard it here, folks -- this is the only place in all of Equestria you'll find it!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>[Flim]</b>
<dl><dd>It can make you shorter, taller, or even grow old
</dd></dl>

</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Are you as worried as I am?
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[splash]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Boy, I just can't believe all the things that Flim Flam Tonic can do!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: When somepony says somethin's too good to be true, it usually is.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: You mean Granny wasted her money?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, I don't know about <i>that</i>, but I don't think there's a tonic in Equestria that can make an old pony young again.
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Howdy!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Granny?!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hang on now! We'll get ya!
</dd><dd>[splash]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [grunts]
</dd><dd>[splash]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Granny, I thought you were too afraid of the water to swim! And, and what about your hip?!
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Well, I reckon it might have been a problem before I had myself a dose of that there Flim Flam Tonic!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I'm not so sure that tonic really <i>does</i> anythin'.
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Doesn't do anythin'?! What d'you call this? [hums a tune]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I'm glad you're feelin' good, but how do you know it's from the tonic?
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: I looked out at the water this mornin' and
 I felt the same terrifyin' aches and pains I always do. But one sip of
that magic elixir and it all went away! Why, I might even get a head
start on my chores! What do you say, Big Mac-a-doo? Up for a little
afternoon applebuckin'?
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Uh, no.
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Oh, quit your bellyachin'!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Gee, it looks like that tonic works after all! I wonder what's in it.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I think maybe it's time we found out.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic in background]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: So you're just gonna walk up and ask them how it works?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I guess. Though if it's a genuine cure, I don't suppose they'll be too keen on sharin' the recipe.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>[Silver Shill]</b>
<dl><dd>–out the door!
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Wait a second! That's that same pony from before!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hey!
</dd><dd>[thudding]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Now hold it right there, Mister...?
</dd><dd><b>Silver Shill</b>: Shill. Silver Shill. Ooh, what do you two want?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Our Granny took some tonic and we want to know how it works.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Granny couldn't swim before, and now she can. Just like you couldn't walk and now <i>you</i> can. But what are you doin' back here? I mean, if the tonic cured you and all...
</dd><dd><b>Silver Shill</b>: [gulps]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: ...Because he's part of the act! It's time for you to tell the truth! You never needed crutches at all, did ya?
</dd><dd><b>Silver Shill</b>: I, uh...
</dd><dd>[whistles blowing]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hey! Huh?
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: Well, if it isn't our most favorite Apple!
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: What brings you back to our humble abode?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: You two charlatans sold my Granny a bottle of tonic, and now she's off actin' like a filly again.
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: What's so bad about that?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: If she keeps gallavantin' around like a
yearlin', she's apt to drop from exhaustion or worse! What's more, I
know for a fact that your friend here is dressin' up as a different pony
 every night so he can <i>pretend</i> to be cured!
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: Well, well, well, that's quite an accusation.
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: But let's say that it's true...
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: Hypothetically...
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: Theoretically...
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: As I understand, your Granny was a famous aquapony.
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: The star of the show, once upon a time.
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: But hasn't set so much as a hoof in the water since.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Until today, that's right.
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: Well, then even if our tonic were nothing more than a mixture of apple juice and beet leaves...
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: Hypothetically...
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: Theoretically...
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: The fact is that Granny is happier now than before she tried it.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I guess...
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: So, the question is...
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: Do you <i>really</i> want to be the pony who takes all that happiness away?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I...
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: There you are! I've been lookin' all over! Did you find out what's in the tonic?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Honestly, Apple Bloom... as long as it works, I... don't suppose it really matters.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Well, if it doesn't matter to you, then it doesn't matter to me either, sis.
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: That's the spirit!
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: Come back anytime!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[splashing]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Hey, Granny! Think you can buck me over the water?
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: I don't see why not! Come on, Big Mac, toss her this way!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Granny, wait!
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Woo-hoo-hoo!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b> and <b>Granny Smith</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Uh, what were you sayin', dear?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Granny, don't you think you should take it kinda easy?
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: I've been takin' it easy for too long! And now, thanks to that Flim Flam Tonic, I don't have to!
</dd><dd>[splash]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Granny, you think I could be an aquapony like you?
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Of course you can, sapling. There's nothin' to it but to do it!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Well, the Ponyville swim meet is comin' up. We could enter together! A legendary water pony like you? We'd be a cinch to win!
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Mm, ee, uh, I don't know... Bein' back in the water is one thing, but a competition is a pony of a different color.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Oh. Okay.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I don't know, Granny. A swim meet sounds
pretty safe. And after all, if that tonic lets you swim in a river and a
 swimmin' hole, a pool should be no problem at all.
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Well, I'll be a tart turnover, you are right! All we need now is more tonic!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[ponies chattering]
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: Welcome, friends, and step right up! The next show starts in five minutes!
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: But why not buy your tonic now and avoid the rush?
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: Right this way, good sir!
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: We'll take the whole case!
</dd><dd>[bits clinking]
</dd><dd><b>"Jinx"</b>: Are you saying this stuff actually works?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: It seems to work for Granny.
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: You heard it here first, folks! Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic is Granny Smith-tested and Applejack-approved!
</dd><dd><b>"Jinx"</b>: If Applejack says it works, that's good enough for me!

</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Fiddlesticks! With the routine we've been workin' on, I'll be a plum puddin' if we don't win this thing!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh... good luck, then!
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Luck? Pfft, who needs luck? We got tonic on our side!
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: Flim Flam's Magical Curative Tonic!
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: Get your Applejack-approved tonic! Granny Smith drinks it – why shouldn't you?
</dd><dd>[ponies cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [sighs] Right.
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Now, if'n you'll excuse us, we got some swimmin' to do!
</dd><dd>[splashing]
</dd><dd>[ponies cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, I'll be...
</dd><dd>[cameras clicking]
</dd><dd><b>Snappy Scoop</b>: That was some of the most amazing
aquabatics I've ever seen! How in Equestria did you do it? Hard work?
Lots of practice? [clicks camera]
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Yeah, but mostly it's the tonic!
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: That's Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic, to be precise.
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: Buy it now while supplies last.
</dd><dd>[ponies chattering]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: What are <i>you</i> doin' here?
</dd><dd><b>Silver Shill</b>: Oh, things are going so well, Flim and
Flam gave me a promotion! Just made my first bit as a salespony. No more
 costumes for this pony. [beat] This is more of a uniform.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: If you say so.
</dd><dd><b>Silver Shill</b>: I used to wonder if I was doing the right
thing. You know, pretending to be cured, basically lying to folks about
this tonic. But thanks to you, I realized that sometimes honesty <i>isn't</i> the best policy.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Thanks to... me?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: With Flim Flam's magical Curative Tonic, my Granny can do anything! Just ask Applejack!
</dd><dd>[cameras clicking]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: No! This has gotta stop! If ponies keep believin' that tonic can do things it can't, who knows what'll happen?
</dd><dd><b>Silver Shill</b>: Maybe something like that?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [gasps] Granny! What in blazes does she think she's doin'?!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Granny's gonna break the Equestria high divin' record!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Land sakes! [catching breath] [gasps]
</dd><dd>[whip cracking noises]
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: [yelps] Now what in tarnation did you do that for?!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: That was the most fool-pony thing I've ever seen anypony do in all my life! You can't do a dive like that!
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Oh, quit your fussin'! I had enough tonic to do a dive ten times as high!
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: Twenty times, by my count.
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: Thirty, with a favorable breeze.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I hate to disappoint everypony, but there's no way Granny could have made that dive, because this tonic is a fake!
</dd><dd>[crowd gasps]
</dd><dd><b>"Jinx"</b>: But you gave it your stamp of approval!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbowshine</b>: Are you saying you lied?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: ...I am.
</dd><dd>[crowd gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I didn't mean to! But everypony seemed so
much happier, I couldn't bring myself to tell you when I found out the
tonic wasn't real. I know it was wrong. I just hope, with time, I can
win back everypony's trust.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: But if the tonic is a fake, then how come Granny can swim again, and what about all that aquabatics stuff we just did?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I reckon sometimes you can forget what you're
 capable of, and it just takes a little extra confidence to remember
that it was inside of you all along. But tellin' ponies your tonic can
do things it can't is just wrong!
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: But you just said it boosts confidence!
</dd><dd><b>Flam</b>: And that's not all it does, folks–
</dd><dd><b>Silver Shill</b>: Yes, it is! In fact, it's not a tonic at
all! I know, 'cause I helped make it! Watching Applejack save Granny and
 then admit to lying, well, that made me realize I was making ponies
believe in a thing that just wasn't so!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Believin' in somethin' can help you do
amazin' things. But if that belief is based on a lie, eventually it's
gonna lead to real trouble.
</dd><dd><b>Silver Shill</b>: Thank you, Applejack. I got this through
dishonest means. That was a mistake I won't be making again! I'd like
you to have it, as a reminder of how you helped me finally see the
truth.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I don't know...
</dd><dd><b>Silver Shill</b>: Oh, don't worry. I'll track down the pony I sold that worthless tonic to and give him another bit to replace this one! Honest.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I'm sorry, Granny. I hope this doesn't mean you'll stop swimmin'.
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Why in tarnation would I do that? I just
can't believe those two salesponies had me believin' I could near fly!
Hey, where'd they go?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: <i>Bein' honest sure gets hard when it seems
like the truth might hurt somepony you care about. But I think believin'
 a lie can end up hurtin' even more. Maybe some ponies don't care about
that – but I sure ain't one of them.</i> Now you take it easy there, Granny!
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Oh, I plan to! Hoo, ha, ha-whee!
