</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Well, that certainly is... round.
</dd><dd><b>Kettle Corn</b>: I can make it rounder!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: I'm afraid that's all the time we have today. We'll try somethin' else tomorrow.
</dd><dd><b>Kettle Corn</b>: But I like circle painting.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: And on the way to figuring out what you're <i>meant</i> to do, you'll find a ton more stuff you like. That's what makes looking for your cutie mark so great.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b> and <b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Mm-hmm.
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Sorry, everypony. We're closin' up shop. We'll have to help you out tomorrow.
</dd><dd><b>Foals</b>: Awwww!
</dd><dd>[door closes]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I don't know if we <i>can</i> help them tomorrow. Working with blank flanks one at a time takes for<i>ever</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: If only there was a way we could help a whole herd of them at once.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: That would be perfect! We'd save time <i>and</i> they could help each other!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Just like we used to! Oh, but it'd have to be somewhere big enough to handle all those blank flanks.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Somewhere outside, with tons of activities to try.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Are you two thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
</dd><dd><b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: <i>Cutie Mark Day Camp!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: And I know just the place, Applejack used to go there when she was little.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: <i>Camp Friendship!</i> Oh. Sorry. I thought we were all gonna yell that one too.

</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: And blank flank affiliates! Come to our cutie mark day camp to find out what you're truly good at!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Bond with other blank flanks and find out what you're meant to do together!
</dd><dd>[ponies chattering]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Hey, Rumble!
</dd><dd><b>Rumble</b>: Oh, hey, Crusaders. Look, I can't stop. I've gotta meet my brother for... something.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: No problem. Just wanted to make sure you heard about our cutie mark day camp. The first session's tomorrow.
</dd><dd>[paper being scrunched]
</dd><dd><b>Thunderlane</b>: What'cha got there, little brother?
</dd><dd><b>Rumble</b>: What? Oh, nothing. Come on! I want to show you a new dive roll I'm trying.

</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Welcome, cutie mark campers!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Who's excited to be here?
</dd><dd><b>Foals</b>: We are! [dissolves into excited chatter]
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Well, we're excited too! At Cutie Mark Day Camp, you'll be able to try all kinds of things!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Kayaking!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Horseshoe-tossing!
</dd><dd><b>Kettle Corn</b>: Circle-painting!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: You can try 'em all! But the most important thing is that you'll be tryin' them together.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: That's what worked for us!
</dd><dd><b>Thunderlane</b>: Then I bet it'll work for these little guys too!

</dd><dd><b>Rumble</b>: I thought you said we were gonna go practice for the Wonderbolts Ponyville Extravaganza show.
</dd><dd><b>Thunderlane</b>: <i>I'm</i> going to Wonderbolt practice. <i>You're</i> going to cutie mark practice.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: And we're glad to have you!
</dd><dd>[foals making awed noises]
</dd><dd><b>Skeedaddle</b>: I can't believe your own brother is a Wonderbolt!

</dd><dd><b>Rumble</b>: [unenthusiastic] Whoops. Aw, it looks like I won't be getting my cutie mark in the horseshoe toss...
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Don't worry about it, Rumble. Hardly anypony finds their calling on the first try.
</dd><dd><b>Rumble</b>: Eh, I wasn't worried.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Good! 'Cause there's a ton of other stuff to try. We'll find you something you're good at.

</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Of course! Let's all meet right back here tomorrow.
</dd><dd><b>Foals</b>: Hooray!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Wow. I can't believe we got a cutie mark on the first day!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Yup. This camp was a pretty swell idea. Everypony's really enjoyed it.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [sighs] Everypony except Rumble. He didn't have much luck with anything.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Trying to find out what you're meant to do can be frustrating. You remember how long it took <i>us</i> to get our cutie marks?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: [shivers] I remember the nightmares.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Well, we can't let Rumble quit camp just because he didn't find something he's good at then.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: We'll just have to convince him to come back and try harder!

</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: We just wanted to apologize for not finding anything you liked today.
</dd><dd><b>Rumble</b>: Oh. Whatever. It's fine.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: It's not fine. It's frustrating, and we know what it's like.
</dd><dd><b>Rumble</b>: I'm not frustrated!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: It's okay! We've all been there. But we won't give up on helping you.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: We know you'll get your cutie mark. Everypony does.
</dd><dd><b>Rumble</b>: Actually, I don't need your help. Because I don't want to get my cutie mark!
</dd><dd><b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: What?!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: I... I must have hay in my ears, because I thought I just heard Rumble say—
</dd><dd><b>Rumble</b>: You heard right! I <i>don't</i> want my cutie mark!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [gasps] <i>He said it again!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Not wanting a cutie mark is like not wanting to breathe!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Everypony wants to know what they're meant to do!
</dd><dd><b>Rumble</b>: Hmph! Not <i>this</i> pony.
</dd><dd><b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: Why?!
</dd><dd><b>Rumble</b>: Because cutie marks are silly, and... a-and they just force you into one thing your whole life!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: That's silly. Having a cutie mark doesn't mean you can't do <i>other</i> things.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Yeah! Our cutie marks are in helpin' other ponies with their cutie marks, but I still like makin' potions with Zecora.
</dd><dd><b>Rumble</b>: And when was the last time you did <i>that</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Um... I-I-I think it was, uh... Well, we've been pretty busy helpin' other ponies lately.
</dd><dd><b>Rumble</b>: Oh. You mean doing the thing you got your cutie mark for? The thing you're stuck doing for the rest of your life?!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Okay. Maybe we <i>will</i> be doing that more than anything else. But we <i>love</i> being Cutie Mark Crusaders!
</dd><dd><b>Rumble</b>: Well, that's fine for <i>you</i>, but <i>I'm</i> not gonna be put in a box!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: A blank flank who doesn't want a cutie mark? That's gotta be the strangest thing I've ever heard.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Granny always says, "Some ponies have to find their own hay."
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Are you sure she didn't mean "find their own <i>way</i>"?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Oh. That would make more sense.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I can't believe Rumble isn't interested in getting his cutie mark either, but we can't force him.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: And we've got a whole camp full of ponies who <i>are</i> interested in getting cutie marks.
</dd><dd><b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: Mm-hmm.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[whoosh]
</dd><dd><b>Rumble</b>: [sighs] Here he comes. The fastest, most elite flyer in Equestria!
</dd><dd><b>Thunderlane</b>: Thunderlane!
</dd><dd><b>Rumble</b>: Whoa! [yelps] Urgh... I was gonna say me. You're not the only Pegasus in the family, you know.
</dd><dd><b>Thunderlane</b>: Oh, sorry, little brother. You're right.
You might be the most elite flyer in Equestria some day. But for now,
you should try other things, too! Speaking of which, aren't you supposed
 to be at camp?
</dd><dd><b>Rumble</b>: [scoffs] That camp is for losers who can't do anything.
</dd><dd><b>Thunderlane</b>: Great, so there's no pressure. You can try everything and not be worried about looking bad.
</dd><dd><b>Rumble</b>: I'm not worried about that. I just don't want to get a cutie mark in any of their ridiculous activities.
</dd><dd><b>Thunderlane</b>: Well, you're still going back tomorrow. You can't be a blank flank forever!
</dd><dd><b>Rumble</b>: Huh...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[bell rings]
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: All right, cutie mark campers, that's it for jam-making!
</dd><dd><b>Pipsqueak</b>: But this is fun, and I didn't get my cutie mark yet. What if I'm not good at anything else?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: You don't get a cutie mark just because you're good at something or even because you like it. There's more to it than that.
</dd><dd>[splat]
</dd><dd><b>Kettle Corn</b>: I'm real good at painting circles, but <i>I</i> got <i>my</i> cutie mark in haikus.
</dd><dd><b>Skeedaddle</b>: Which is what <i>I</i> like! But... I'm still a blank flank like you.
</dd><dd><b>Pipsqueak</b>: So you can't get a cutie mark in something you like?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Now, we didn't say that.
</dd><dd><b>Rumble</b>: You don't have to!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Rumble, you came back!
</dd><dd><b>Rumble</b>: Say bye-bye to painting circles. You'll be too busy haiku-ing from now on!
</dd><dd><b>Kettle Corn</b>: But... I like circles.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Come on, Rumble. That's not how cutie marks work.
</dd><dd><b>Pipsqueak</b>: So that's how cutie marks work?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Am I speakin' Olde Ponish?! I just said it wasn't!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>[Rumble]</b>
<dl><dd>"Cutie marks are great," they say
</dd><dd>Pfft, yeah, right!
</dd><dd>They make you special in your way
</dd><dd>But that special mark that's just for you
</dd><dd>Will erase the stuff you liiiiiiike... to do
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Kettle Corn</b>: So, no more painting?
</dd><dd><b>Skeedaddle</b>: No more haiku?
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Rumble, stop! That's just not true!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>[Rumble]</b>
<dl><dd>So you're good at charming snakes
</dd><dd>Too bad!

</dd><dd>Oh, well!

</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Well, [inhales] [motor-mouth] it started
when he couldn't toss a horseshoe or paddle a kayak or shoot an arrow or
 use a pencil, and we felt bad that he wasn't good at anything, but now
he doesn't want a cutie mark at all because he's afraid he'll get stuck
doing something he doesn't like forever, you know? [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Thunderlane</b>: No, I don't. Rumble's good at all that stuff.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Well, that doesn't make a lick of sense. Unless... he was bein' bad at stuff on purpose!
</dd><dd><b>Thunderlane</b>: [sighs] I was afraid of this...
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Afraid of what?
</dd><dd><b>Thunderlane</b>: Ever since I became a Wonderbolt, Rumble's
either watching me or trying to fly like me. He won't do anything else.
That's why I thought your camp was such a good idea.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I don't understand. If Rumble wants to be a Wonderbolt someday, what's wrong with that?
</dd><dd><b>Thunderlane</b>: Not a thing. But right now, he isn't even giving anything else a chance.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Sounds to me like Rumble isn't afraid of bein' put in a box at all.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: It doesn't?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Nope. I think Rumble's already picked out a box. He's afraid he'll get a cutie mark that'll keep him from it.
