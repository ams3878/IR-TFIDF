</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Order, order, everypony! I hereby call to order this meeting of the Rainbow Dash Fan Club!
</dd><dd>[fans murmuring excitedly]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: First order of business – [quickly]
Let's-celebrate-the-one-and-only-Rainbow-Dash-yay-she's-amazing-now-if-there's-nothing-else-that-concludes-this-meeting-of-the-Rainbow-Dash-Fan-Club-thank-you-all-for-coming-any-questions?!
</dd><dd>[bang]
</dd><dd>[confused murmuring]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Huh?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Meeting adjourned!
</dd><dd>[door slams]
</dd><dd>[bang, bang]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I'd like to call to order the first ever
meeting of the newest and most exciting club – of which I am the
president, founding, and only member – the Washouts Fan Club!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [gasps]

<dl><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh, hey, Scootaloo. I was just in the neighbor— Oh! What's this? Did I interrupt your fan club meeting?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Hey! What are you doin' here?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I could ask <i>you</i> the same question!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Oh, uh, y'know... mmm... s-s-stuff. Uh, definitely not starting a new fan club or anything.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ha! It's no use pretending! I heard everything when I was outside eavesdropping, like I do for <i>every</i> meeting!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: You eavesdrop on every meeting? That's weird.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, sure it <i>sounds</i> weird when you
 say it out loud. And I probably shouldn't because eavesdropping is
wrong, but still. Why are you starting a new fan club?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I just think maybe it's time for me to explore <i>other</i> fan clubs.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [gasps] What is a "The Washouts"?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Only the newest, and greatest, and only stunt troupe in Equestria!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Stunt troupe?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: How can I explain it? Like the Wonderbolts, just twenty bajillion percent cooler! [squee]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: "Twenty bajillion"?!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: They do all sorts of extreme stunts that focus on daredevilry and sheer guts rather than boring old flight and formation junk.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: "Boring old flight and formation junk"?!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Are you just repeating everything I say?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Only because my brain feels like it's strapped to one of those rockets about to explode.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: So you <i>do</i> get it! Aren't they awesome?!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Can you believe she actually said that?!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Pfft, well, yeah! Eavesdropping on every meeting <i>is</i> kinda weird.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I mean, she basically said that the Wonderbolts aren't cool! And... And it kinda sounded like she didn't think <i>I</i>
 was cool either. But, peh, we all know that's crazy! I mean, I'm
definitely not worried about her looking up to somepony else. Heh. Nope.
 Not! At! All!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, I'd understand if you were. It'd be
like if Apple Bloom started lovin' bananas more than apples. [laughs,
sotto voce] Y'all tell me if that ever happens, ya hear?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: But what could the Washouts possibly have that I don't?!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Why don't you find out?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: They're doing a show in Ponyville this weekend?!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Wow! They <i>do</i> look pretty amazing... uh, -ly <i>un</i>amazing. [nervous laugh] Trying so hard to look amazing is what I mean.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Nice save, Twilight! [squee]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[crowd chattering]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Awww. I <i>knew</i> we shoulda lined up last night.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I'm sorry for making us late. Who would've
guessed Xtreme Chocolate Airshow Cupcakes would take an x-tremely long
time to bake? [slurps, chomps]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Look at this! It's a total Wonderbolts ripoff!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: What do you mean? The show hasn't even started yet.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, but look at what we're sitting on.
</dd><dd>[bang, bang]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hello?! The Wonderbolts have bleachers, too! We practically <i>invented</i> sitting on bleachers!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Ugh!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: And look at that! Popcorn <i>and</i> cotton candy?! Ripoff!
</dd><dd>[feedback]
</dd><dd>[music]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Huh? Yeeeeeeeaaaahhh!
</dd><dd><b>Announcer</b>: <i>This is the time! This is the place! This is the team! This is... the Washouts!</i>
</dd><dd>[crowd cheers]
</dd><dd>[explosions]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Mmmm! Quality confetti cannon work.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sighs]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Oh, yeah!
</dd><dd><b>Announcer</b>: <i>Say it with me now, the Washouts' official motto...</i>
</dd><dd><b>Announcer</b> and <b>Crowd</b>: Leap before you look!
</dd><dd>[crowd cheers]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Woo-hoo!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Lame.
</dd><dd><b>Fanpony</b>: Oh!
</dd><dd><b>Announcer</b>: <i>Remember, ponies. While they're amazingly
awesome, the Washouts are highly trained professionals in protective
fire-proof flight suits! Do NOT try this at home!</i>
</dd><dd>[kaboom!]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Whoa. Come on, come on! She's not gonna make it!
</dd><dd>[clang!]
</dd><dd>[crowd gasps]
</dd><dd>[crowd cheers]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That... was... <i>insane!</i> Woo-hoo!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I told you!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I mean... [clears throat] It was pretty cool. Who are these guys?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I can't just go up and talk to them.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You can if you're with me. After all, one of the reasons there's a Rainbow Dash fan club is because I'm fearless. Observe.
</dd><dd>[water splashing]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hey!
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, so as a fellow aerobatic professional,
 I really enjoyed your show. Heh. Actually, you might recognize me since
 I'm a... pause for dramatic effect... a Wonderbolt.
</dd><dd><b>Short Fuse</b> and <b>Rolling Thunder</b>: [laugh]
</dd><dd><b>Rolling Thunder</b>: [Australian accent] Ha! Join the club.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [excited noises]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: O... kay...
</dd><dd><b>Rolling Thunder</b>: No. I mean, literally. Join the club.
We're called "The Washouts" because we all used to be Wonderbolts just
like you. Heh. Until we "washed out".
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: No way!
</dd><dd><b>Rolling Thunder</b>: Yep. [sighs] Name's Rolling Thunder. I
got booted out of Wonderbolt Academy because of "flagrant disregard for
hazardous weather". Pfft! If doing barrel rolls through nine hundred
million volts of electricity in a raging thunderstorm is wrong, then I
don't wanna be right.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Cool!
</dd><dd><b>Rolling Thunder</b>: Ha. This 'ere's Short Fuse.
</dd><dd><b>Short Fuse</b>: Ah, nice to meet you.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What's your story?
</dd><dd><b>Short Fuse</b>: <big><i>ANGER ISSUES! GET OFF MY BACK!</i></big>
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uhhh... Okay. So, who's the leader?
</dd><dd><b>Rolling Thunder</b>: Only the most reckless ex-Wonderbolt of all time.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [gasps] Lightning Dust!
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: Rainbow Dash!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [snarls]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Scootaloo. I'm Scootaloo. Hi.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Lightning Dust! I should've known you were
the brains behind a crazy idea like the Washouts! Or should I say, "lack
 of brains"!
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: [snarls]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: You two really know each other? Oh, my gosh! This is so cool!
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: Your "friend" got me kicked out of the Wonderbolts.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Oh. That's, uh, less cool.
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: And it was the best thing that ever happened to me! Great to see you, wingpony! I heard you're a full-fledged Bolt now.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, well, I'm still—
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: Mad at me? Look, was it wrong of me to endanger the lives of your friends? Yeah. But, hey, now I only endanger <i>these</i> knuckleheads.
</dd><dd><b>Rolling Thunder</b> and <b>Short Fuse</b>: [laugh]
</dd><dd><b>Short Fuse</b>: [through gritted teeth] Don't call me "Knucklehead"! [laughs]
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: C'mon, you know you miss me. Me and her, we blew everypony out of the sky.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Really?
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: Actually, yeah, really! All that wind was totally dangerous, but we had fun, right? Two fastest times on the Dizzitron!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: If I remember correctly, I had you beat by half a second.
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: Only because when <i>I</i> went, I cranked up the dizziness factor.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b> and <b>Lightning Dust</b>: [laugh]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, I'm glad it all worked out. Your show was pretty dynamite.
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: [to Scootaloo] Wanna know the secret? We basically ignore everything the Wonderbolts ever taught us about safety.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, we do have safety rules for a reason.
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: Don't listen to her, kid. All their
"rules" were just ways of keeping their little club exclusive so they
could feel good about themselves.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: It's not about making anypony feel bad. It's about finding the best flyers. The best of the best.
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: I started the Washouts because I believe
 anypony can be the best of the best. You know, Rolling Thunder is gonna
 be out for a while.
</dd><dd><b>Rolling Thunder</b>: Ah, during the finale, I caught the old hind leg in the Crushinator Jaws of Smashalot! Patent pending.
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: There's a spot on the team if you wanna join up.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I appreciate the offer, but I'm already a Wonderbolt.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I'll do it! Can I do it?!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, lemme think. No!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [scoffs] I wasn't asking <i>you</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: Awww, you're cute. But technically, you haven't washed out of the Bolts, which is kinda our thing.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: And also, <i>no!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Oh, what if I joined and dropped out super quick?!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That's it! You're comin' with me!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Where are we going?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: To hear what the actual Wonderbolts think about you joining just to drop out for the Washouts!
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: Say hi to Spitfire for me!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[Wonderbolts theme]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [yawns]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ever seen two simultaneous inverse displacement rolls before?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [scoffs] Would've been a lot cooler if you had the Crushinator Jaws of Smashalot, patent pending.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You... <i>What?!</i> [to Spitfire] See? This is what I was telling you about.
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: I got this. [to Scootaloo] You know what happens when something goes wrong with the Crushinator Jaws of Smashalot?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Patent pending?
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: You end up in a <i>full body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: But with enough practice—
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: Practice?! Well, la-dee-<i>doodle-dah!</i> Lemme give you a different scenario. You're probably saying to yourself, "I'm young. I'm strong. I'm gonna go out there and <i>stunt</i> some <i>tricks</i> with my new friend <i>Lightning Dust</i>!" Well, I'm here to tell ya that if ya play <i>that</i> game, you're gonna find out it's pretty hard to "stunt tricks" in a <i><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">full body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw!</span></i>
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I think she gets the poi—
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: <i><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">I'm not finished!</span></i> Listen, I get it, kid. I used to be like you, tellin' myself, "I'm gonna touch the sky!"
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I don't—
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: Well, whoop-dee-<i><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">doodle-doo!</span></i>
 You think you got it made in the shade? Well, things are gonna be
pretty shady indeed when you can't go out in the sun, 'cause you're in a
 <i><b><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">full body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw! Do I make myself clear?!</span></b></i>
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [shakily] Uh-huh...
</dd><dd><b>Spitfire</b>: Excellent. Have a hat.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh... Heh. Sorry that was a little...
intense. I just wanna make sure you don't get hurt. That way, you can
follow in my hoofsteps. Heh. Everypony's dream, right?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: More like "follow your wingflaps".
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Same difference.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [sarcastically] Thanks, super-talented flyer, for clearing up what <i>I</i> should do.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Clearing things up is one of my
specialties. Now, come on. Let's go rip up all your Washout posters into
 tiny pieces and throw 'em off a cliff.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I just thought of a great way to raise awareness for your original fan club. You know, the one about me?
</dd><dd>[clatter]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: How about a silent auction where every item is just a picture of yours truly? [laughs] Nah! I'm just kidding.
</dd><dd>[blow dryer blowing]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That makes me seem too egotistical,
doesn't it? Oh, oh! Maybe if they're framed, it's like, "Wow, she's so
humble!" Ya think? Scootaloo?
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, Scootaloo?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Anypony seen Scootalo—
</dd><dd>[bump!]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ow! My fault, my fault! Sorry, I— Twilight?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [groans] Sorry. I was just... um...
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Please tell me you got that stuff so you could rip it up and throw it off a cliff.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: They were doing an autograph session before practice.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Seriously?! [groans] You haven't seen Scoot, have you?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Actually...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I can't believe Scootaloo ditched me to watch them practice! Why can't she see how dangerous they are?!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That's kind of the whole draw. It's exciting.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: But it's like the harder I try to convince Scoot they're dangerous, the more she likes them!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You can't control her actions. Only
yours. Teach her what's safe and what isn't, like a good role model.
Then hope she makes the right decisions.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: But what if she chooses them over me? She's gonna get hurt!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I think I know somepony else who might get hurt if <i>that</i> happens.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Um, maybe you're right. But this isn't about me. I'm just worried about Scoot.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[clanging]
</dd><dd><b>Short Fuse</b>: Wow. You're really workin' hard on this new stunt. [chomps, spits] <big><i><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">What kind of sorry excuse for a tomato sandwich is this?!</span></i></big>
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: Sorry, Dash. Autograph session's over. Unless you wanna buy Short Fuse's limited edition half-eaten tomato sandwich.
</dd><dd><b>Short Fuse</b>: <big><i><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">I'm not signing that abomination!</span></i></big>
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You haven't seen Scootaloo, have you?
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: Ohhhh, isn't she that pony that used to respect you?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [growls] I'd appreciate you helping me find her so I could apologize for trying to make her quit liking you.
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: [laughs] Oh, I'm pretty sure she still likes us.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [gasps]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Lightning Dust, I know we go way back, but I can't let her do this!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I don't need you standing up for me!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Obviously, you do! Because you can't see how dangerous this is! Do you not remember what Spitfire said?
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: Ugh. Lemme guess. [imitating Spitfire] You'll be in a full-body wing-and-hoof cast <i><b><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">drinkin' through a straw!</span></b></i>
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That doesn't even sound like Spitfire.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That's it! We're leaving!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Just because I look up to you doesn't mean I have to <i>be</i> you! But based on <i>your</i> definition of what makes somepony great, I have bad news. I'll <i>never</i>
 be the best of the best or a Wonderbolt! Because I! Can't! Fly! Is that
 what you wanted to hear? But not being able to fly doesn't mean I can't
 do something awesome! Like strapping my scooter to a multi-stage
liquid-fueled rocket and jumping twenty-two wagons lined up in front of a
 roaring crowd!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That was awfully specific.
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: That's 'cause it's what she'll be doing in the show tonight. Half off for princesses! [whispering] Bring your friends!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Scootaloo, are you sure that's what you really wanna do?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Absolutely. [to Rainbow] And there's nothing you can do to stop me!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You're right. You're your own foal, and you have to make your own decisions.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Good! Because I already have!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sighs]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[crowd chattering]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Sorry for making us late again. Who would've
 guessed Scootaloo's super-difficult stunt special cupcakes would've
been super-difficult to bake? [chomps]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hoo-wee! Looks like all of Ponyville is here. Except for Rainbow Dash.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sighs]
</dd><dd><b>Announcer</b>: <i>And here to introduce the most dangerous
stunt we've ever performed, it's your fearless captain,
L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-Lightning Dust!</i>
</dd><dd>[crowd cheers]
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: In just a moment, the newest member of
the Washouts will be rocket-sledding down that hill, up that ramp, and
over all twenty-two wagons to land on the other side in one piece! Heh.
If she's lucky.
</dd><dd>[crowd gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: Put your hooves together for Half-Pint Dynamite!
</dd><dd>[crowd cheers]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Lightning Dust, I have to tell you. I
actually started Equestria's first Washouts fan club! As far as I know.
So this is a real honor, ma'am! Uh, do I call you "ma'am"?
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: You land this jump, you can call me whatever you want.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Wow. That sure is...
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: Dangerous? Nah! Well, maybe a little.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Has anypony tested it before?
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: Where's the fun in that?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [gulps]
</dd><dd>[tape stretching]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: There's m-more?!
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: You're not thinking of backing out, are you?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: No! I'm just thinking about drinking through straws.
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: Are you the president of my fan club or not?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Of course! It's just—
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: You wouldn't wanna get impeached for dishonoring my wishes, would you?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I... Is that a thing?
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: Light it up!
</dd><dd>[flames roaring]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Okay. Now I <i>am</i> thinking about backing out.
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: Too late!
</dd><dd>[rockets roaring]
</dd><dd>[crowd cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [whimpering]
</dd><dd>[crowd gasps]
</dd><dd>[whoosh!]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I know I was supposed to let you make your
 own decisions, but that doesn't mean I can't swoop in and save you from
 time to time.
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: If I'd known you were gonna bail, I would've done the trick myself!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Great! So you won't mind how that rope's about to coil around your hoof.
</dd><dd>[snap!]
</dd><dd><b>Lightning Dust</b>: RIVALS FOR LIIIIIFE!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Wouldn't have it any other way!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I'm sorry for joining the Washouts. Lightning
 Dust wasn't who I thought she was. She didn't care about me being
scared or putting me in danger. She only wanted a good show, even if it
meant I got hurt. That's <i>not</i> the kind of pony I wanna look up to.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: <i>I'm</i> the one who should be
apologizing for not acting like somepony who deserves a fan club. I've
been lucky enough to have somepony who thinks I'm the coolest. But
there's nothing cool about making you feel like you'll never be as
awesome as me. I think we should cancel the Washouts Fan Club. Because I
 know a fan club that could use some new members.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: The Rainbow Dash Fan Club!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[bang, bang, bang]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [clears throat] Welcome to the first ever
meeting of the newest fan club for the awesomest, previously
under-appreciated pony in Ponyville! With founding member and president
Rainbow Dash presiding, it's the... Scootaloo Fan Club!
</dd><dd>[fans cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: You know, Rainbow Dash was right. Eavesdropping on your own fan club isn't weird at all.
