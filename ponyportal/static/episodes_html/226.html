<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I got your text, Rainbow Dash! Did
something come through the portal? Is Equestrian magic on the loose? Did
 Twilight come back with a problem that only we can solve?!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Has a giant cake monster covered all the cakes in the world in cake?!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Um, not exactly.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Uh, I don't understand.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, Sunset, I was just tellin' Rainbow Dash here that a broken guitar string doesn't really qualify as an emergency.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: It totally does!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Really, Rainbow Dash! I was in the middle of sewing a very complex appliqué on my latest frock.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: And I was just about to tuck everyone in for the night at the shelter. Now we'll have to start stories all over again.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Why would you send all of us an emergency text for a guitar string?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, I was going to pony up and show our
fans some awesome guitar licks, but I kinda need all six strings to do
it. Got any extra?
</dd><dd><b>All but Rainbow Dash</b>: [groan]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Here. But everyone finished practicing for the day. I'm pretty sure all the music rooms are locked.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: No problem. The acoustics in the hallway are perfect for power chords. [plays chord] C'mon! Let's go!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: You comin', Sunset?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I'll catch up in a bit. [voiceover] <i>Dear
 Princess Twilight, how's life treating you in Equestria? Any cool new
magic spells? It's been pretty quiet here at CHS since the Battle of the
 Bands. We still pony up when we play music, which Rainbow Dash just
loves to show off. But I still can't quite grasp what it's all about. I
would love to hear what you think about it when you get a sec. Your
friend, Sunset Shimmer.</i>

</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: She was definitely doing something to the statue – or was going to.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Do you think she came through the portal from Equestria?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: No, I'm pretty sure I woulda noticed that. I think she was from over here.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, that's a relief. The last thing we need
 is another magical so-and-so bent on world domination comin' over from
Equestria.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Agreed. I have no interest in another fight
against the powers of evil magic. The wear and tear on my wardrobe is
just too much to keep up with.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Still, a mysterious figure snooping around the portal? Don't you wanna know what she was up to?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [shudders] I don't even wanna guess.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, you don't have to. Because I've totally figured out who it was!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ooh, ooh! A nighttime statue cleaner? A magical portal maintenance maintainer? A gardener?!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Seeing as how they got off a bus <i>from</i> the city and got back on a bus headed <i>to</i> the city, I'll bet they go to...
</dd><dd><b>All but Sunset Shimmer</b>: Crystal Prep.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yep. With the Friendship Games starting tomorrow, they'd totally try to prank us by defacing the Wondercolts statue.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Why would anyone take a bus all the way from the city for that?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Because the Crystal Prep Shadowbolts are our biggest rivals?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Because that's just what the students at Crystal Prep would do?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Because even though they beat us in everything – soccer, tennis, golf – they <i>still</i> have to gloat!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Seems kinda silly to me.
</dd><dd><b>All but Sunset Shimmer</b>: Silly?!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: So I guess you think the Friendship Games are silly, too.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Well, it's not like we'll be fighting the powers of evil magic.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: No. We'll be fighting against a school full of meanies. Not everything has to be magical to be important.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: You're right. I'm sorry. I know it's a big deal.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [scoffs] That's putting it mildly, darling. They're still revamping the playing field in preparation.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I just don't understand why there's this
 big rivalry. Aren't the "Friendship Games" supposed to be about our two
 schools getting along?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, it's kinda hard to get along with someone who beats you at everything.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Not anymore! This time, things are gonna be different.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: What do you mean?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh, you'll find out.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: As I am sure you all know, tomorrow,
Canterlot High School will be hosting our fellow students from Crystal
Prep Academy as we join together in the spirit of excellence,
sportsmanship, and fidelity to compete in the Friendship Games.
</dd><dd><b>Students</b>: [unenthused cheering, sparse applause]
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: Since the games only happen every four years, I'm sure you're all curious what goes on.
</dd><dd><b>Flash Sentry</b>: You mean other than us losing?!
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: And <i>that</i> is exactly why I've asked Rainbow Dash to come up and give you all a little, um... context.
</dd><dd>[microphone feedback]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Thank you, Principal Celestia. [clears
throat] I know a lot of you might think there's no way we can beat a
fancy school like Crystal Prep at anything.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Unless it's a "losing to Crystal Prep" competition! 'Cause we're <i>really</i> good at that!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [groans] And I know that CHS has never won the Friendship Games even once.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, dear. I hope this speech isn't meant to be motivational.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Crystal Prep students are super athletic, super smart, and super motivated. But there's one thing they <i>aren't</i>. They aren't Wondercolts!

</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I feel like my school pride is at an all-time high!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Is anybody else wonderin' how Dash ponied up without playin' her guitar?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I know, right? It's probably because I'm so awesome!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Maybe. I mean, you <i>are</i> awesome, but there's gotta be more to it than that, right? It just seems so random.
</dd><dd><b>Vice Principal Luna</b>: Well, it would be nice if you girls
 could get a handle on it. We'd like to keep magic as far away from the
Friendship Games as possible. We don't want to be accused of cheating.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: We don't need magic to defeat those hoity-toity Crystal Preppers.
</dd><dd><b>All but Rarity, Sunset Shimmer, and Luna</b>: [agreeing]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Vice Principal Luna</b>: Still, the Friendship Games are
serious business. We don't want any surprises. Especially the kind that
could cause us to forfeit. Sunset Shimmer, you came here from a world of
 magic. Perhaps you can get to the bottom of <i>our</i> magical development.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I'll do my best.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Okay. Anybody have any guesses what the events are gonna be?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Pie eating? Cake eating? [gasps] Pie-cake eating?!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: They won't even let us see what they're doin'
 to the field. You think they'd at least tell competitors what they're
competing in.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: It could be anything.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Anything?! How will I ever pick the right outfit?!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I really wanna help, but I think I better go focus on figuring out why Rainbow Dash ponied up. See ya later!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Seems like she's got everything under control. Nothing to worry about.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Ugh! [sighs] [voiceover] <i>Hey,
Twilight. Haven't heard back from you yet. I guess you must be pretty
busy with your role as princess. But I could really use your advice
right now. You see, I've been given the job of keeping magic under
control here at CHS, even though I still haven't quite wrapped my head
around it. And now after seeing Rainbow Dash pony up the way she did, it
 makes me think her magic might be... changing. Everyone is looking to
me to figure things out and I really don't wanna let them down. But I'm
not sure I have enough experience with friendship magic to solve this.</i>

it, Spike. With this device, I can track and contain the bizarre energy
coming from Canterlot High.
</dd><dd><b>Puppy Spike</b>: [growls]
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: I know you didn't like me going over there, but
 I just couldn't wait. And soon, I'll have all the time I need. All of
Crystal Prep is gonna be there for the Friendship Games. I just hope all
 that "rivalry" nonsense doesn't get in the way of my research. If I can
 collect enough data on these EM frequencies, I should be able to
extrapolate the waveforms to determine their origin. That would
practically guarantee my entrance into the Everton Independent Study
Program! Whoa!
</dd><dd>[knock on door]
</dd><dd><b>Dean Cadance</b>: Twilight, you know the rules against pets.
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: Well, Spike isn't a pet, Dean Cadance. He's the
 focus of my research project. Human-canine cohabitation: effects and
implications.
</dd><dd><b>Dean Cadance</b>: If you say so. But Principal Cinch is highly allergic, so I suggest you put on a clean shirt.
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: Why?
</dd><dd><b>Dean Cadance</b>: Because she wants to see you.
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: Ooh! Maybe she has news about my application to Everton!
</dd><dd><b>Dean Cadance</b>: I've been meaning to talk to you about that. Are you sure that's what you really want?
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: Why wouldn't it be? A program that allows me to
 focus all my attention on my own advanced math and science projects?
What a dream come true!
</dd><dd><b>Dean Cadance</b>: But there aren't any classrooms with other students. You'll be doing everything on your own.
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: That <i>is</i> why it's called an "independent study program".
</dd><dd><b>Dean Cadance</b>: I just don't want you to miss out on
anything. That's all. Being around other people isn't a bad thing.
Sometimes it's how you learn the most about yourself.
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: I guess.
</dd><dd><b>Dean Cadance</b>: Meet you in Principal Cinch's office in a few minutes?
</dd><dd>[door closes]

</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: Shining Armor? Why is my brother here?
</dd><dd><b>Dean Cadance</b>: As an alumni, Principal Cinch thought he could provide some unique perspective.
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: Perspective on what?
</dd><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: Why, the Friendship Games, of course. You competed in the games, did you not, Shining Armor?
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: [ahem] I did.
</dd><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: And you happen to recall who won?
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: Ha ha, Crystal Prep did. We <i>always</i> win.
</dd><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: We <i>always</i> win.
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: Why did you ask to see me?
</dd><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: Twilight, I'll be honest. It doesn't
matter whether or not Crystal Prep wins or loses. [monkeyshine squeaks]
The important thing is we are <i>expected</i> to win because Crystal
Prep has a reputation. And it is that reputation... my reputation that
is responsible for everything we have here. For everything you've done
here. And you've done quite a lot, haven't you?
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: I don't know. I guess.
</dd><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: Oh, don't be modest. You're the best
student this school has ever seen. What I can't understand is why my
best student wouldn't want to compete.
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: In the Friendship Games?
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: Look, Twily, I know it's not really your
thing, but representing the school is kind of a big deal. Plus, they
could really use your help.
</dd><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: It seems Canterlot High is undergoing
something of a renaissance. Test scores are up, grades, even athletics
are on the rise. You see, they are developing somewhat of a reputation.
This can <i>not</i> happen!
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: Principal Cinch, I can't possibly participate in the games. My work here is very—
</dd><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: Ah, yes. Your work. Cadance, could you and Shining Armor find my contact sheet for the Everton Independent Study program?
</dd><dd><b>Dean Cadance</b>: Of course.
</dd><dd>[door closes]
</dd><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: I understand you've applied. You see,
one of the advantages of having a reputation is a certain amount of
influence in such things. So, let me offer you a deal. In return for
contributing your agile mind to these games, I will use my influence to
guarantee your application is approved. Though, I suppose I could also
have it... denied. What do <i>you</i> think I should do?

</dd><dd><b>Puppy Spike</b>: [whimpers]
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: I know, Spike. I don't like it either. I
probably won't be able to collect anywhere near as much data as I

</dd><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: The smart ones are always curious. I'll return her to check in with the rest of her classmates.
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: I didn't know Twilight had a twin sister.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: She doesn't! That Twilight is obviously the Twilight from <i>this</i>
 world since it couldn't possibly be the Twilight from the pony world
since the Twilight from the pony world doesn't go to Crystal Prep or
wear glasses.
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: Nevermind.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: I'm sorry, Principal Cinch. I was just following these strange readings. Actually, they led me to those girls and—
</dd><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: Twilight, what you do in your free time
 is of little interest to me, but while you're here, I... all of Crystal
 Prep, in fact, require your complete focus.
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: But why does everyone at this school seem to know me?
</dd><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: Perhaps they're trying to confuse you. Perhaps they're trying to lure you away.
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: It didn't feel like anyone was trying to lure me.
</dd><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: I don't know what they're planning, but I guarantee, it isn't to help us win.

<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I can't believe our world's Twilight goes to Crystal Prep!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You're saying that Twilight's gonna play <i>against</i> us? She'd never do that!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: <i>Our</i> Twilight wouldn't.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [angrily] Our Twilight is a princess in Equestria and an expert in friendship magic! And if <i>she</i>
 was here, we'd have already figured out why magic is randomly popping
up during pep rallies and costume changes. [deep breath] Sorry. I'm just
 frustrated that I haven't heard back from her.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: She's a princess in Equestria. Probably got problems of her own to deal with.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: We certainly can't expect her to drop everything
 and pop through the portal whenever. Especially if it's to deal with
something as minor as a few random pony-ups.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: But they aren't minor! Magic came into
this world when I stole Twilight's crown. It's taken a lot for me to
earn everyone's trust. If we have to forfeit the games because I can't
think of a way to keep it under control...
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, Sunset, I'm sure you'll be able to figure things out.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: You're the one who helped us understand what was goin' on with the sirens. Remember?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I guess. But Twilight was the one who really figured out what we needed to defeat them.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: But don't you remember, darling? What we needed to defeat them was you.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [sighs] All right.
</dd><dd><b>All but Sunset Shimmer</b>: [cheering]

</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Um, we do.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: All right, everyone. Let's not get too competitive before the games even start.
</dd><dd><b>Sugarcoat</b>: The games aren't really competitive since <i>we've</i> never lost.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: That's not a very nice thing to say.
</dd><dd><b>Sunny Flare</b>: Sorry, dearie, but these games aren't about being nice.

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hi, I'm Pinkie Pie!

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I know. You look just like my friend. Her name is Twilight too.
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: That's... heh, weird.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: What's that?
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: It's sort of a spectrometer. I built it to track EM frequencies, but it can also contain anomalies. [beat] It measures things.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Like the party?
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: Yeah, though it doesn't look like much of a party to me.

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Party cannons, of course!

</dd><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: I'd like to thank Principal Celestia
for her unconventional welcome. It's been four years since the last
Friendship Games, but it feels as though nothing has changed. Canterlot
High continues to pick its competitors in a popularity contest and
Crystal Prep continues to field its top twelve students. It is a comfort
 to know that even after so many years of <i>losses</i>, your school remains committed to its ideals, however <i>misguided</i> they may be. I wish you all the best of luck, regardless of the inevitable outcome.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I'm sorry, Pinkie. I thought your party additions were really swell.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: They definitely broke the ice.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Yes. If only that Principal Cinch hadn't frozen it again.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yeah, she's awful.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Wow, Pinkie, what happened to you?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I don't know. Everyone started having fun after Twilight and I fired the party cannons and I ponied up.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Of course you did.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: But then the magic just drained right out of me.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Wait, what do you mean "drained out of you"?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hey. Where <i>is</i> that other Twilight?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh. She's right... Uh, well, she <i>was</i> right here.

<dl><dd><b>Vice Principal Luna</b>: [over P.A. system] Good morning,

Friendship Games. Our competitors will face off in every aspect of the

</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I don't know. She doesn't seem like the magic-stealin' type.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Yeah, but she had something to do with closing the portal. If her pendant can pull in magic, maybe it stole the portal, too.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: How?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I don't know. And the pony or person or princess who could help me figure this out is completely unreachable now.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Which is too bad, because Twilight knows everything about magic and portals and magical portals and portable magics!
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: For now, let's just focus on beating the
Shadowbolts. And as long as this event puts me in a playing field, I
don't think we've got anything to worry about.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Oh, it puts you on a playin' field, alright.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps loudly]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Am I the only one who thinks this is overkill?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [to Rarity] I don't suppose you made motocross outfits.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, don't be ridiculous. Of course I did!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: You will race in pairs. Indigo Zap and Sugarcoat will handle the motocross.
</dd><dd><b>Indigo Zap</b>: Yes!
</dd><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: Lemon Zest and Sunny Flare have requested the short track.
</dd><dd><b>Lemon Zest</b> and <b>Sunny Flare</b>: [high five each other]
</dd><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: Since archery is a standard requirement
 at our school, any of you should be able to do it. Twilight and Sour
Sweet will start us off.
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: [sweetly] Well, that's just marvelous! [sourly] If you wanna lose before we even start!
</dd><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: Given that Twilight won the last event
single-handedly, I have every confidence that she will be able to pull
her weight here. Won't you?

</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: Um, excuse me, I didn't mean for any of this to
 happen. I just wanted to learn about the strange energy coming from

<dl><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: [clears throat]
</dd><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: You can't possibly call <i>that</i> a fair race.
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: Principal Cinch, we all saw what happened. You can't think CHS had some kind of advantage.
</dd><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: Can't I? Even without your trained attack plants, your students have wings!
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: Well, the race certainly had some... extenuating circumstances. Perhaps we should end the games now and declare a tie.
</dd><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: A tie? Was this your strategy all
along? To force us into accepting you as equals? I think not. The games
will continue and Crystal Prep will prevail despite your antics and
whatever performance-enhancing regimen your students are on.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I'm sorry I couldn't stop all this from happening.
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: It's not your fault, Sunset.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Isn't it? I should know how to control
the magic I brought here. But I don't. I let everyone down. And now
Principal Cinch thinks we're cheating.
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: It doesn't matter what Principal Cinch thinks.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: But it does. The students here at CHS
don't just wanna win. They wanna beat Crystal Prep. It isn't gonna count
 if the other side doesn't really think they lost. Crystal Prep is never
 gonna believe we won fair and square if there's magic around. And that
magic is only around... because of me.
</dd></dl>

</dd><dd><b>Dean Cadance</b>: Since the score's tied, the final event will determine the winner of the Friendship Games.
</dd><dd><b>Vice Principal Luna</b>: Somewhere on campus, a pennant from
 each school has been hidden. The first team to find their school's flag
 and bring it back wins.
</dd><dd><b>Dean Cadance</b>: And as soon as our teams are ready, we'll begin.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I don't feel like playing these games anymore.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: But we <i>have</i> to play. This is the last event!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [scoffs] It's a little hard to focus with all the magic stealing and portal opening.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: And I feel awful about what I said to Twilight.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Especially since she obviously didn't mean to do all the stuff she did. She's actually really nice.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [facepalms]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Let's just get through this last event and prove we're not a bunch of cheaters. Then you can go over and apologize.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: I know I'm asking you to beat a team
that isn't playing fair, but Canterlot High must be made to understand
that even with magic at their disposal, beating Crystal Prep is simply
not an option.
</dd><dd><b>Sugarcoat</b>: What if they grow wings again?
</dd><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: A fair question. Though I believe we
can now fight fire with fire. I've seen what your device can do,
Twilight. Containing magical energy is fine, but have you considered
releasing it?
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: But I don't even understand how it works.
</dd><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: But you'd like to. And since our
opponents have already used it to stay competitive, I see no reason why
we shouldn't do the same. Unless, of course, you have no <i>interest</i>
 in Everton. Though, honestly, I think there's more knowledge packed in
that little device than any independent study program could offer.

<dl><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: [angrily] Principal Celestia, on behalf
of Crystal Prep, I demand that you forfeit the Friendship Games!
Clearly, CHS has had unfair advantage for quite some time! And it's
certainly obvious that your students have been using magic for their own
 benefit!
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: I'd like to think that saving the world benefits us all.
</dd><dd><b>Sugarcoat</b>: At least they didn't manipulate Twilight into
 releasing all the stolen magic and turning into a power-crazed magical
creature that tried to rip the world apart just to win a game.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Wow! That's a lot to take in when you say it all at once.
</dd><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: That's ridiculous!
</dd><dd><b>Puppy Spike</b>: Nope, that's pretty much what happened.
</dd><dd><b>Sour Sweet</b>: [sweetly] Actually, we're <i>all</i> to blame. [sourly] Mostly it was her.
</dd><dd><b>Principal Cinch</b>: Obviously my students have been infected with your magic, but I plan on taking all of this up with the school board!
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: Good. I'm sure they would be very interested in hearing all about the magical students with wings.
</dd><dd><b>Vice Principal Luna</b>: Oh, and the portals to different dimensions.
</dd><dd><b>Dean Cadance</b>: And don't forget to tell them about the talking dog. [giggles]

 through, I think it's fair to declare us all winners.
</dd><dd>[everyone cheers]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Dean Cadance</b>: I guess that was <i>one</i> way to finish up your time at Crystal Prep. Pretty sure Cinch will be fast-tracking your application after all of that.
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: I've been thinking about it and... I'm not so sure now is the time for me to apply to Everton.
</dd><dd><b>Dean Cadance</b>: Really?
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: I may know about a lot of things, but
friendship isn't really one of them. And I'm definitely not gonna learn
more about it by being alone all the time.
</dd><dd><b>Dean Cadance</b>: So, you're staying at Crystal Prep?
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: Well, it seems the students here at CHS know an awful lot about the subject. I don't suppose...
</dd><dd><b>Dean Cadance</b>: You could transfer to <i>this</i> school instead.
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: Really?
</dd><dd><b>Dean Cadance</b>: You'd certainly be missed at Crystal Prep.
 But I think that's a great idea! I'll be sure to speak to Principal
Celestia about it right away.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Still no word from Princess Twilight?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Not yet. But I think I may have figured
out how magic works in this world. We pony up when we're showing the
truest part of ourselves. I was so busy waiting for someone else to give
 me the answers that I gave up looking for them myself. I'm sure there
will be more magical problems that pop up in this world, but like
Applejack said, Princess Twilight has her own problems to worry about in
 Equestria. We can't expect her to always be around to help us.
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: But maybe I can be?
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: It seems we have a new Wondercolt here at Canterlot High!
</dd><dd><b>Sci-Twi</b>: I'm not sure how much help I could be. But I'd like to try. If you would all give me a chance.
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: I'm sure I can count on you girls to help her feel at home.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: You sure can.

<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm so sorry I didn't get here sooner! I
