<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Five hundred and sixty-six, five hundred and sixty-seven, five hundred and sixty-eight... Phew! Look at <i>that</i>, Pound Cake! I am <i>so</i> close to breaking my personal cupcake-icing record!
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: My goodness! I can't believe what I'm seeing here!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Pretty impressive if I do say so myself.
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: Pinkie, would you mind watching the counter
while I pop to the supply room? We've just received a very special
order, and the ingredients need to be perfect.
</dd><dd><b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [squeals]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Okie-dokie-lokie.
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: Thanks, dear!
</dd><dd>[zip]
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: A baby?! Shining Armor and Princess Cadance
are having a baby?! [squeals] This is the best news ever! I can't wait
to tell Twilight!
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: Oh, em, Pinkie, uh... [whispers] it's a top secret surprise.
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake </b>and <b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [prolonged shushing]
</dd><dd>[door closes]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: A top secret surprise?! That means I have to keep the exciting news... [gulps] ...to myself!

<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Even though I didn't <i>technically</i> make a Pinkie Promise to Mrs. Cake, I can't tell Twilight or <i>anypony</i> the big news! That would make me a... a... a big old surprise ruiner! Right, Gummy?
</dd><dd><b>Gummy</b>: [sucking on pacifier]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Did you take that from Pound Cake again? Don't you know it's wrong to steal from a baby?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: What's all this about a baby?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: What? Who? What? Who said something about a baby?!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: You did, Ms. Pie, just now. What were you talking about?
</dd><dd>[pop]

<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Great! Everypony's here. Now I don't
have to wait any longer to tell you all the wonderful news! Somepony
special is coming to visit Ponyville, and I need your help getting
everything ready!
</dd><dd>[main cast chattering]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's...
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b> and <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Shining Armor and Princess Cadance!
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yes, and they're coming—
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b> and <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Tomorrow!
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yes, on the—
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Friendship Express rather than the Crystal
Empire train so as not to cause too much of a scene when they skip town
to come visit? [squee]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yes.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Annnnnd?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And that's it.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, how did <i>you</i> know all that?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [nervous laugh] Uh... Pinkie Sense?
</dd><dd>[stretching noise]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: So, you said you needed our help with something?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Follow me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Sweet posters! Is that Smash Fortune?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It sure is! When Shining Armor said he
 wanted to come to the castle and visit, I started collecting things he
liked when he was a colt as a surprise!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Surprise?! [nervous laugh]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I've been so excited that it's been hard to keep it to myself!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [slightly muffled] I have no idea what that's like!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Aww, look at the cute little ant farm!
</dd><dd>[ant screeches]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: And check out all these old comic books!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Be careful! They're mint-in-bag!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [blowing] [nervous whistling]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: What's this?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: This is Brutus Force. Shining Armor used to carry him around like his baby!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yeah! [nervous laugh] Really cute! [nervous laugh]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: It is a bit juvenile for castle décor, but it is very sweet of you.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I'm sure Shining Armor will love it.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Me, too. But there's a few more things I'd like to add before he gets here, and I could really use a hoof collecting them.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Whatever you need, sugarcube, we'll help you get it.
</dd><dd><b>Rest of main cast sans Twilight</b>: [various agreements]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Thanks, everypony! I just can't wait 'til they walk in and see everything!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: <i>Totally</i> understandable. Watching
somepony else be surprised with something is almost better than being
the one who's getting the surprise!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: But... eh... what if the surprise is
something so incredibly exciting that a pony can't keep it in any
longer, and she has to tell the pony standing next to her what it is or
she might <i>explode</i>?!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I would say... no.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: The pony who ruins a surprise for somepony else has to live with that guilt <i>forever</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [nervous laugh] Gotta bounce!
</dd><dd>[pinball noises]
</dd><dd>[crash]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: So, I know the bar is set pretty high, but does anypony else think Pinkie Pie was acting weirder than usual?

</dd><dd>[door shuts]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [heavy breathing] Phew, that was close! Too close. I almost spilled the beans. Beans that would be <i>really</i>
 hard to clean up! I obviously can't be around my friends right now. Or
anypony for that matter! Hmmm... That's it! If Shining Armor and Cadance
 are coming tomorrow, then all I have to do is lock myself in my room
away from everypony until they arrive! Then I won't ruin anything!
</dd><dd><b>Mr. Cake</b>: Oh, good, you're back! Mrs. Cake needs my
help, but these deliveries can't wait! I can't thank you enough for
agreeing to be my backup delivery pony, Pinkie!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I... did?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Mr. Cake</b>: Maybe I should hire somepony to be my backup delivery pony.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I'll do it!
</dd><dd><b>Mr. Cake</b>: Really?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Sure! There's no possible way that I could
ever have anything that might interfere with doing that task, like a
gigantic, emotionally exhausting surprise that would make it super hard
to be around other ponies.
</dd><dd><b>Mr. Cake</b>: Great! Uh, you're sure you won't change your mind?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No way! Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh, yeah. I Pinkie Promised I'd do it. And I never break a Pinkie Promise! Never!
</dd><dd><b>Mr. Cake</b>: Well, thanks again! You're a real cake-saver!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [deflates, sighs] Hm. Maybe it'll be a quiet day and I can just avoid everypony!

</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Heard any good gossip today?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Yeah, we're bored. Please say you have some interesting news.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Nope!
</dd><dd>[thump]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ugh! Fluttershy, what a surprise! I mean, <i>not</i> a surprise! [squee]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: You were in such a rush earlier. Twilight
wanted me to ask you if you would bring some snacks to the castle for
Shining Armor and Cadance's visit.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Definitely! Got it! Pinkie Promise! Yeah! Heh.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: You know, maybe some baby carrots...
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [nervous laugh] What did you say?!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Baby carrots! They're Shining Armor's favorite.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Mine too! Baby carrots are kinda like big
carrots but smaller, kinda like how foals are tiny versions of their
parents but smaller and cuter and— Albino squirrel!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Where? Is it Albert?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: It's time to kick this operation into hyper-hoof and avoid all ponies by any means necessary!

<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: It didn't feel good ignoring my friends like that... Maybe I can tell just <i>one</i> little pony the surprise?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [with reverb] <i>The pony who ruins a surprise for somepony else has to live with that guilt forever!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You're right,
spooky-reflection-of-Rarity-that-I-know-is-actually-my-own-imagination. I
 can't tell anypony at all! [sighs] Then they would tell Twilight, and
she wouldn't be surprised, and it would be all my fault.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [sighs] Finally, I'm all aloney on my owney.
</dd><dd>[paper rustling]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Wow, great idea! I'm starving too! [chewing]
 [with mouth full] This apple is delicious! [swallows] What are you
having, Gummy? Oh, no! It's the list that Twilight helped me make
yesterday so I wouldn't forget all of my Pinkie Promises <i>today</i>!
And I have three more things to do! Aw, four if you count bringing those
 snacks to Twilight's castle! I've been getting liberal with those
Pinkie Promises lately...

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Interesting choice of words, Featherweight.

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No, I'm not!
</dd><dd><b>Mayor Mare</b>: [hushed] Speaking of secrets, have you ever known somepony else's secret?
</dd><dd>[papers rustling]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Noooooo...
</dd><dd><b>Mayor Mare</b>: [hushed] A surprise that was so big and exciting that it was all you could think about?

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [reading] "Treat your foal like... royalty"?!

<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Those look yummy, Pinkie! Let me help you! But we better cover them up so they don't get spoiled.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Why would they get spoiled? We're all gonna eat them super soon!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Oh, didn't anypony tell you? Shining Armor and Cadance are held up. They may not arrive 'til Saturday.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>Whaaaaaaaaaat?!</i> [hyperventilating] You mean... [breathes] I have... [breathes] to wait... [breathes] another whole day?! I don't know if I can!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie Pie, do you have something you need to say? You seem like you've been keeping something in.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [inarticulate yell]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: We're here to listen.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, go on then, sugarcube.

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [exhales]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Shining Armor, Cadance! You're early! I thought something had come up and you weren't gonna make it until Saturday!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: So did we. Turned out we weren't needed in Maretonia until <i>next</i> week. And the summit we were supposed to attend today had to be rescheduled, so... we got here even sooner than planned!
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: Surprise!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: It's wonderful to see you all again!

<dl><dd><b>Main cast sans Pinkie Pie</b> and <b>Princess Cadance</b>: [chattering]
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: [hushed] Lucky we came when we did, huh?
I'm guessing you saw the scroll we sent to Mr. and Mrs. Cake? Hey, I'm
impressed you've been able to keep our secret <i>this</i> long!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: So you're gonna tell Twilight now?!
</dd><dd>[honk]
</dd><dd><b>Main cast sans Pinkie Pie</b> and <b>Princess Cadance</b>: [chattering]
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: [hushed] You're gonna have to wait just a little bit longer. We have something special planned. It'll be worth it, I promise.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: It'd better be.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: So, do you think Shining Armor liked his surprise?

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Where did Shining Armor and Cadance say they'd meet us? [stomach rumbling] I'm <i>starving</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: In the town square. I wish they'd waited to walk over with us, but they said they had something to take care of first!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [through gritted teeth] They're gonna have a lot more to take care of soon...
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Nothiiiiiiing!
</dd><dd>[zoom]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That's odd. Usually they're quite punctual.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ughhh! I need a hayburger in my belly <i>right now</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What's this? [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: What does it say?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: A scavenger hunt! Shining Armor used
to set these up for me when I was a filly! At the end, there was always a
 big prize, like a new book, or several new books, or—
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: We get the picture! You like books!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: So what's the first clue?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I hope it's something about eating lunch!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [reading quickly] "You've got a scroll,
you're on a roll, why don't you take a peek where young ones spend their
 week? A piece of paper will continue this caper."
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I've got it! "Where the young ones spend their week."

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[school bell ringing]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's the Ponyville Schoolhouse!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Good enough for me! Now where's the next clue? [panting like a dog] [sniffing] [sneezes]
</dd><dd><b>Featherweight</b>: Extra, extra! Get your Ponyville news! Read it in the paper! Extra, extra! [continues repeating under]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: "A piece of paper will continue this caper." [gasps] It's in the <i>Foal Free Press</i>!
</dd><dd>[paper rustling]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Ooh, look at that dress Mayor Mare is wearing in the social report! Why, it's stunning!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh, didn't <i>you</i> make that, Rarity?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Yes, what is your point?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>Focus, everypony!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You know, there's really no time limit on these scavenger hunts, Pinkie.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Aha! There! [tapping paper]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [reading] "Though this hall is rather
small, in it you'll find files of all kinds. Take a look on the back of
the birth certificate of Applejack."
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I don't like where this is goin'.

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: A-<i>hem</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Does anypony know where the birth certificates are kept?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ooh! I do, I do! Go down that hall, then you
 take a left, then a right, then another right, then a slight left, and
it's the third door from the right!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Wow, Pinkie. I never knew you knew so much about town hall.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: There's a lot of things I know! That you don't know I know!

</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: [laughs] There's still a prize, but it's a little different this time.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh. I don't understand.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [giggles quietly]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: All the places we sent you today had something in common.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: First we went to the schoolhouse...
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [trembling]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And then we read the <i>Foal Free Press</i>... After that we found Applejack's birth certificate... And then the last clue was under a crib.

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hmmm... School... foal... birth certificate... and crib... [gasps] Can it be? Are you two...?!
