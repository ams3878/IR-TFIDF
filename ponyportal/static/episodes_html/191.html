<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The Tree of Harmony remains one of the
most powerful sources of magic known to ponydom. And though it has been
at the "root" of magic and friendship from the moment it was planted,
its ways are mysterious. Almost as if it has a mind of its own.
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: Mind? [scoffs] It's a tree.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: A tree that grew a castle.
</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: Was that before or after Discord made chocolate rain?
</dd><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: [whispers] After.
</dd><dd><b>Gallus</b>: I'm never gonna learn pony history!
</dd><dd>[school bell rings]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You can all show me what you've learned on tomorrow's test – "Friendship's Effect on the Course of Equestrian History".
</dd><dd>[students groan]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Remember! Study groups are both fun <i>and</i> effective!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[students chattering]
</dd><dd><b>Sandbar</b>: So, who wants to study together?
</dd><dd><b>Gallus</b>: With other students? This is Equestria! If you
want the real scoop, there's only one place to go. Hello, oh maaaaagical
 Equestrian tree! Can you tell me everything I need to know about
friendship?

</dd><dd><b>Sandbar</b> and <b>Ocellus</b>: [groan]
</dd><dd><b>Ocellus</b>: No! The <i>Pillars</i> grew the Tree.
</dd><dd><b>Sandbar</b>: The Tree grew the Elements, and then the box with six locks.
</dd><dd><b>Ocellus</b>: But our professors found six keys and unlocked the box.
</dd><dd><b>Gallus</b>: I'm so gonna fail.
</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: You guys! Check this out!
</dd><dd><b>Gallus</b>: That's a plumbing diagram on how to fix a sink.
</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: [giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Sandbar</b>: What does that have to do with Equestrian history?
</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: Nothing. I just can't believe that's how sinks work! Where's Yona?
</dd><dd><b>Yona</b>: [snoring]
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: [laughs] Apparently, [imitating Yona] yaks no love study groups!
</dd><dd><b>Gallus</b>: Shhhh. [laughs]

</dd><dd><b>Sandbar</b>: Hey, Cozy. What are you doing here?
</dd><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: I volunteered to help Professor Sparkle organize these books. So, experts on Equestrian history yet?
</dd><dd><b>Gallus</b>: I think I'd be better off studying the plumbing book. This stuff is impossible.

</dd><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: [clears throat] Golly, it's so inspiring how relaxed you all are about studying friendship, considering your disadvantage.
</dd><dd><b>Yona</b>: What cute pony mean?
</dd><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: Just consider where you all came from. If
Sandbar hadn't sacrificed so much of his time to get you up to speed,
who knows how behind you'd be?
</dd><dd><b>Sandbar</b>: That's... not what—
</dd><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: [to Ocellus] I mean, growing up as a
love-starved changeling? [to Silverstream] Or hiding underwater from an
evil king all those years? Trusting anycreature must be so hard for you.
 [to Gallus] And griffons never want to be around anycreature, even
other griffons. [to Smolder] And dragons are so fierce compared to us.
There must be days you can't wait to get away from all us cute ponies.
[to Yona, imitating Yona] "Everypony know yaks think yaks are best!"
Making friends with any other creature must seem like a step down. It's
just so impressive how you keep trying to understand friendship, even
though it isn't in your nature. Oh! I'll let you borrow my notes! It's
what friends do. I'll be right back!
</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: We... should... get back to studying.

</dd><dd><b>Ocellus</b>: That's why we're studying together.

</dd><dd><b>Illusion Twilight Sparkle</b>: [stilted] It is as I feared. You are not one. What has happened?
</dd><dd><b>Ocellus</b>: We were studying friendship's effect on history, but then...
</dd><dd><b>Gallus</b>: Since friendship just isn't in our nature, what's the point?
</dd><dd><b>Illusion Twilight Sparkle</b>: [stilted] You do not believe friendship is in your nature? <i>That is NOT acceptable!</i>

</dd><dd><b><span title="as Twilight Sparkle" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted">Tree of Harmony</span></b>:

school! We found this and went down and met the Tree, and Gallus was
all, [imitating Gallus] "Friendship is not in our nature." And the Tree
was like, "Whaaaaat?!" And it tested us!
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: Long story short, friendship <i>is</i> in our nature. The Tree said so.

I'll get you an extension!
