</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Attention, everypony! Attention! The official
 Rainbow Dash Fan Club will come to order. Let's get right down to our
first order of business. I motion that Rainbow Dash be declared the most
 awesome pony in Ponyville.
</dd><dd><b>Snails</b>: I second the motion, and might I add that if you
 looked up the word 'awesome' in the dictionary, there would be a
picture of Rainbow Dash.
</dd><dd>[ponies agreeing]
</dd><dd><b>Snips</b>: I object!
</dd><dd>[ponies gasp]
</dd><dd><b>Snips</b>: I think the word 'awesome' is played out! Rainbow Dash deserves better! I motion that we declare her the most <i>stupendous</i> pony!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: 'Stupendous'? Is that the best you've got? I motion that we declare her... wonderiffic!
</dd><dd><b>Snips</b>: Astonishing!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Breathtaking!
</dd><dd><b>Snips</b>: Astounding!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Bedazzling!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What about super-ultra-extreme-awesomazing?
</dd><dd>[ponies agreeing]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: All in favor of declaring Rainbow Dash the most 'super-ultra-extra-uh-whatever you said' pony in all of Ponyville, say 'aye'!
</dd><dd><b>Fan club</b>: Aye! [cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [giggles]

<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sigh] What a beautiful day. There's nothing like a dip in the clouds to make a Pegasus feel super relaxed.
</dd><dd><b>Aura</b>: Help! Help! Help! Help!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Looks like my sky swim will have to wait! I'm Rainbow Dash, and I'm here to rescue you!
</dd><dd>[ponies cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Wow. What's with this crowd? Uh, thanks, everypony. It was really no big deal.
</dd><dd><b>Aura</b>: To me it was! You're my hero, Rainbow Dash!
</dd><dd>[ponies cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: That Rainbow Dash sure is something.
</dd><dd><b>Snips</b> and <b>Snails</b>: Something special.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>"Millie"</b>: [screams]
</dd><dd><b>Cream Puff</b>: [crying]
</dd><dd>[ponies cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [gasps] Oh no! There's something wrong with the baby!
</dd><dd>[crowd gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: She's not cheering for everypony's favorite hero, Rainbow Dash!
</dd><dd>[ponies cheering]
</dd><dd>[cameras clicking]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: There just aren't enough words in the dictionary to describe Rainbow Dash's awesomeness.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I can think of a few new words.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: And I bet 'modest' is not one of them.
</dd><dd>[ponies cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No, but she is kinda awesome.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[elderly ponies chattering]
</dd><dd>[splintering wood]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow Dash is here!
</dd><dd>[elderly ponies screaming]
</dd><dd>[ponies cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Pony 1</b>: We'd be lost without you!
</dd><dd><b>Pony 2</b>: You're our hero, Rainbow Dash!
</dd><dd><b>Crowd</b>: Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I can't hear you!
</dd><dd><b>Crowd</b>: Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Call me silly, but I think this whole hero thing might be going to Rainbow Dash's head.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You may be right...silly.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: And then I zoomed into the well. I knew it
would be dark and dangerous, but I didn't let that stop me. Danger's my
middle name. Rainbow 'Danger' Dash. Thinking back on it, I acted pretty
awesomely heroic that day.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: That day.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Awesomely heroic that day and awesomely <i>arrogant</i> ever since.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b> and <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Mm-hm.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hey, Applejack. How'd you like to be <i>immortalized</i> as my friend?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Immorta-what?
</dd><dd>[camera clicking]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Are you taking notes?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Yup! I've been hoof-picked by Rainbow Dash herself, to write her autobiography!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Umm, autobiographies are supposed to be written <i>by</i> the pony they are about.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Maybe for your normal, run-of-the-mill ponies. But I'm <i>far</i> too busy saving lives to stop and write. That's why I hired Spike as my ghost writer.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [yelps] Spike's a ghost!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: ...Anyway. Spike here writes down everything I say. Don't you, Spike?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Don't... you... Spike. Got it!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: This way, I can stay focused on performing
 those acts of bravery that nopony else has the guts to perform. Yep, it
 takes guts. But it also takes brains. And sometimes a big lunch and a
nap. Being a hero is surely not for everypony, but I'm up to the
challenge.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [grunts] There you go.
</dd><dd><b>"Lemon Daze"</b>: Someday, I wanna be just like you!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Aim high, kid, but don't aim for the impossible.
</dd><dd><b>Cherry Berry</b>: [screams]
</dd><dd>[ponies gasp]
</dd><dd><b>Cherry Berry</b>: Help! Help!
</dd><dd><b>Snips</b>: Uh, don't you think you should go and help?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [muffled] Yeah, yeah. I've got a good ten seconds to spare. Just a couple more.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: The tension is unbearable. Will Rainbow Dash make it on time?
</dd><dd>[ponies cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Pony</b>: Holy turnips, that pony came outta nowhere!
</dd><dd><b>Daisy</b>: I've never seen such bravery in all my life!
</dd><dd><b>Mayor Mare</b>: That's right! Ponyville has a new hero. A
mysterious mare that has done well by our fair city today. I dub this
new masked hero 'The Mysterious Mare Do Well'!
</dd><dd>[ponies cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Mare Do Well, huh? Well that <i>mare</i> would <i>do well</i> to stay outta my way! Ponyville's only got room for one hero, and that hero is me!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[ponies screaming]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [clears throat] Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow–
</dd><dd><b>Globe Trotter</b>: Excuse me, uh, do you think you could skip your catchphrase and just hurry up and save us?!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ugh, fine! Picky, picky. Whoaaaa! Aah!
</dd><dd>[ponies cheering]
</dd><dd><b>"Wisp"</b>: Oh, thank you, Mare Do We– e...
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I can't believe it. Mare Do Well is stronger than <i>me?</i> Well, a hero is more than just muscle, and she's gonna learn that the <i>hard</i> way.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[jackhammer and drills]
</dd><dd><b>Crafty Crate</b>: Huh?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Huh? Never fear, your friendly neighbor– Whoa!
</dd><dd>[building creaking]
</dd><dd>[crashing]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Never fear– Uh! I'm coming! Hold on! Whoa!
</dd><dd><b>Jack Hammer</b>: Look!
</dd><dd><b>Crafty Crate</b>: [cheers]
</dd><dd><b>"Jim Beam"</b>: Look out for the– Watch out for falling– On your left! Agh! Your other left!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Here ya go, safe and sound.
</dd><dd>[crash]
</dd><dd><b>"Jim Beam"</b>: [faints]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, Mare Do Well, or should I call you Mare Do <i>Slow</i>? You're gonna have to pick up the pace if you wanna compete with me, 'cause I move like lightning.
</dd><dd><b>"Rivet"</b>: Actually, she saved all of us! We owe her our lives!
</dd><dd>[ponies cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [growls] Okay. She's strong, fast, and somehow knows what's gonna happen ahead of time. I've gotta step up my game.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[water rushing]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [gasps] If the dam breaks, the whole town will be flooded! Looks like Ponyville needs a hero! Easy peasy.
</dd><dd>[stone cracking]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: My game is officially back on. If only
somepony were here to pat me on the back. Eh, guess I'll have do it
myself– [yelps] [screams] Help! [spits] Help! You?! I suppose you want
me to thank– You <i>gotta</i> be kidding me...
</dd><dd>[ponies cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Lemme get this straight. She's strong, she's agile, <i>and</i> she's magic? Ughhh! How do I compete with <i>that</i>? Wait a minute. I do have a leg up on her. And that leg is... wings! Hah! Take that, Mare Do Well!
</dd><dd>[ponies cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh, for the love of Pete.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Gotta hand it to the girl, that Mare Do Well sure can pull off some pretty heroic feats.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I must say, I was impressed by that
spell she used to fix the dam. Seems like something like that would take
 quite a bit of study.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [growls]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: She really cares about everypony's safety.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Have you <i>seen</i> her costume? It is to die for! If you ask me she's a hero of fashion.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: <i>And</i> she's modest <i>and</i> humble. She lets her actions speak for themselves. Gotta admire that.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I <i>don't</i> have to admire that! I don't think she's all that great!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: She's... great.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I didn't say that.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Sounds like somepony's jealous.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Who, me?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Rainbow Dash is jealous.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Don't write that, Spike!
</dd><dd>[others laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Correction: Rainbow Dash is <i>very</i> jealous.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Fine! Laugh all you want, but I'll be the one laughing when I prove to you all that I'm just as good– no, that I'm a <i>better</i> hero than Mare Do Well!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Huh, no sign of trouble here. Darn it.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Buses and baby carriages are <i>always</i> careening down this hill. Where is an out-of-control vehicle when you need one?!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Rrgh, there are absolutely no freak
natural disasters going on anywhere! How am I supposed to prove myself
when everything's so normal and safe? [gasps] Hold it right there,
Granny Smith! You don't have to pretend with me. I can see that you're
in way over your head here.
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Eh, what's that?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You're putting on a brave face, I get it. But you don't have to anymore. I'll help you cross the street!
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: [grunting] Actually, I can cross the street just fine!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Don't worry! You're in extremely... capable... hooves!
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: [panicked grunts] Back off!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [pants] Here we are! Safe and sound. A good and heroic citizen deserves a little recognition, <i>don't you think</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: I didn't wanna cross the street in the first place! [complaining and squeaking]
</dd><dd><b>Amethyst Star</b>: [grunting]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [gasps] Somepony's in trouble!
</dd><dd><b>Amethyst Star</b>: [grunting]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You'd better let me handle this, ma'am! For your own safety, I must ask you to stand back!
</dd><dd><b>Amethyst Star</b>: Oh, brother.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [cracks neck] [grunting]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ta-da!
</dd><dd><b>Amethyst Star</b>: Uh... thanks.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: How would you describe what I just did? Would you say I was amazing?
</dd><dd><b>Amethyst Star</b>: Aren't you milking this a bit?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Please, just answer the question! Was I, or was I not, amazing?
</dd><dd><b>Amethyst Star</b>: Oh, you're amazing alright. An amazingly–
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh, look!
</dd><dd>[lawnmower rattling]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Another great feat of heroism! I have just saved that grass!
</dd><dd><b>"Pine Breeze"</b>: From what?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: From weeds! Weeds that were attempting to eat this lawn!
</dd><dd><b>Liza Doolots</b>: Lame...
</dd><dd><b>Pony</b>: Whatever.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Aww, who am I kidding?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[thundercloud rumbles throughout]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: All anypony talks about is Mare Do Well this and Mare Do Well that! What about <i>me</i>?
 How could everypony forget about me so easily? I mean... have I
changed? Same sleek body. Same flowing mane. Same spectacular hooves.
Nope, I'm still awesome. <i>They're</i> wrong. But... then... why am I all alone? I hate being all alone.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Hey, Rainbow Dash!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I knew it! No need to apologize, squirt. Anypony could make that mistake.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Mistake? What mistake?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Wait a minute. Why are you here?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: To invite you to join us! We're heading off to the thank you parade for Ponyville's greatest hero, Mare Do Well.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: No! No way! Can't you see I-I wanna be alone? I <i>love</i> being alone.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Oh, okay. See you later then.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, <i>right,</i> like I'm gonna thank <i>her.</i> [mockingly] Thank you, Mare Do Well, whoever you are, for ruining e– [normal] Hey, squirt! Wait up!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Mayor Mare</b>: Welcome to Ponyville's first, but surely not
last, thank you parade, in honor of our city's greatest hero, the
mysterious Mare Do Well!
</dd><dd>[ponies cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: The mysterious Mare Do Well, huh?
</dd><dd>[ponies gasp]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: So what are you hiding? Let's see how mysterious you are without that mask!
</dd><dd><b>Mare Do Well</b>: [whistles]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What the hay?
</dd><dd><b>Mare Do Well</b>: [whistles]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Grrr... I got you now! Alright, Miss Mysterious! Mystery... solved! [yelps] P-p-p-p- <i>Pinkie</i>?! Whudda- hud-d-duh- hud-d-duh- <i>huh</i>?! Twilight?! Applejack?! There were <i>three</i> of you?!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yup, we all played Mare Do Well at different times.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: <i>I</i> stopped the carriage bus with these babies, Bucky McGillicuddy and Kicks McGee.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I saved the construction workers with my Pinkie Sense. [twitches]
</dd><dd>[flowerpot shatters]
</dd><dd><b>Cherry Berry</b>: Sorry!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: It's alright.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And <i>I</i> used my magic to fix the dam.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Ooh, ooh! And I did the flyby afterwards.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: <i>I</i> made the costumes. Fabulous if I do say so myself!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I don't understand. <i>Why?</i> Don't you want me to be a hero?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Of <i>course</i> we want you to be a hero.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: But a <i>real</i> hero doesn't brag.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, I guess I did start to brag a little.
</dd><dd><b>Other main cast</b>: A little?!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Okay, a lot.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Celebrating your accomplishments is natural. But...
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: ...Rubbin' them in everypony's face is not.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yeah, the only thing that should be rubbed in anypony's face is chocolate cake. [slurp]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I think we're getting off topic here.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What we're trying to say is, <i>it's great to be really good at something, but it's important to act with grace and humility.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ohhhh. That makes <i>loads</i> more sense. Yeah. You're right. <i>And I guess I should've also acted with grace and humility when others outshine me.</i> Like Mare Do Well.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Sounds like you've got a letter to write to Princess Celestia.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Already got it covered. As your ghost writer, I've already penned a letter to the Princess.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That's nice of you, Spike, but I really wanna write this letter myself.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Aww, <i>come on</i>, I wrote the whole thing already!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Okay, let's hear it.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [clears throat] <i>Dear Princess Cel</i>-
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Look out! It's a <i>real</i> ghost!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b> and <b>Spike</b>: [yelping and screaming]
</dd><dd><b>Others</b>: [laughing]
