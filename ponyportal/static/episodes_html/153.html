<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [strained gasping]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I know! I can't believe it either! The map has never called <i>me</i> before!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I'm sure that's not why she looks... like that.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [babbles] Actually, it is. Well, it's
that and the fact that you're being called to the royal palace! I mean,
what in Equestria could be going on there?! You want me to come with
you?! No. I shouldn't. The map just called you for a reason, right? Heh.
 Though maybe it's a mistake. Not because of you! Because it's never
called just one of us before. [nervous chuckle]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I also wasn't nervous before, but now...
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Don't worry. For all we know, it's
something small. Like maybe the cooks are fighting over who has the best
 butternut squash soup. Or the royal hairdressers are fighting over a
comb.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Or, you know, maybe the royal sisters aren't seeing eye-to-eye on something.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No! That's just crazy! Luna and Celestia would never fight. [beat] Again.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: So the map sent <i>you</i> to solve a friendship problem?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Yes, princess.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Well, there's nothing wrong here. Right, sister?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: [sourly] No. Everything's perfect as usual, sister.

</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [groans]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Psst! Pssst!
</dd><dd>[music box playing]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Twilight? Is that you? How are you here?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [quickly] I'm not. I'm still home.
It's an easy spell. I'll show you later. Anyway, enough about me. I had
to check on you. Not in a meddling kind of way! In a friendly "how's it
going?" kind of way. So, how's it going?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [sighs] Not great. I think the problem might be between Celestia and Luna.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, no, that's terrible! I mean, what makes you say that?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: You know how some ponies say nothing's wrong but you can tell something's definitely wrong?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [nervously] Noooooo... Heh.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: That's basically what the princesses did when I said there was a friendship problem. Only they did it more, you know, regally.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, I wish I could help you, but I can't – both for map reasons and because I have no idea! This is big! Like, <i>really</i> big! But I'm here if you ever need to talk. Or listen to music.
</dd><dd>[music box playing]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Heh. Comforting, right?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [groans]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Thank you so much for breakfast, princess. I can't believe you cook it yourself.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Of course, Starlight! I really enjoy doing it. It's a small way to say I care.
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Good morning, sister! Join us?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: [sourly] Too tired. [chomp] Please excuse me.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Wow. Last night must've been really hard on her.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: [sighs] Perhaps. But she is like this every morning.
</dd><dd>[clatter]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: So I think Luna may be hurting her sister's feelings without even realizing it.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Poor Celestia. That's so sweet that she makes her sister pancakes every morning.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: She's your mentor. I think you might be biased.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Fair enough. So what are you gonna do?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Nothing, yet. I have to get all the facts. I asked Luna if I could spend some time with her this evening.
</dd><dd>[knock, knock, knock]
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Guard</b>: Princess Luna's waiting for you, miss.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [chuckling nervously]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Good luck, Starlight!
</dd><dd><b>Guard</b>: [surprised whinny]
</dd><dd>[door closes]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Wow, Princess Luna. You do this every night?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: Lavender's calming scent is known to aid dreamers in achieving a restorative sleep.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [sniffs] That's so thoughtful!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: I try my best to make sure the ponies in this castle sleep peacefully.
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Fleur De Verre</b>: And so, then I said, "Touring? More like 'boring'!" [airy laughter]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: [laughs] Oh, you really are a card!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: [sighs] But as always, my sister is too busy having fun with dignitary ponies to acknowledge anything I do. Hmph!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: So, both princesses are hurting each
other without realizing it. And instead of talking about it, they're
just getting colder and more distant.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And they're Celestia and Luna. So it's not like you can just confront them.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Actually, that's exactly what I was gonna do.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What?! Are you crazy?! I mean, heh, you do whatever you think is best. This is <i>your</i> mission.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [sarcastically] Gee, thanks for believing in me, Twilight.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I do. But the last time the princesses
 fought, Luna turned into Nightmare Moon, and Princess Celestia had to
banish her for a thousand years! That can't happen again!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Well, I can't do nothing. The princesses aren't the best at communicating with each other.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps] Sorry. It's just, you said "princesses" and "aren't the best" in the same sentence, and it's making me nervous!
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm not much help, am I?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: No!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Wow. I almost feel bad eating this. It's adorable.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Like I said, I enjoy this part.
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: [sourly, mouth full] Hi.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Uh, Princess Luna! Wait! [deep
breath] As you both know, the map sent me here for a reason, and I...
think I found out what it is.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Really? Oh, that is wonderful, Starlight! What is it?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: You two.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Excuse me?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: [simultaneous] I beg your pardon?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I think you're accidentally hurting
each other's feelings without realizing it. Princess Celestia, does it
bother you that Luna never notices the wonderful breakfasts that you
prepare for her?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Uh... Y-Yes. It does.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Princess Luna, tell Celestia how you
feel about the fact that she never acknowledges the work you put into
lining the hallway with lavender every night.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: I... Well, I... I-It's not the best
feeling. [to Celestia] I'm sorry I never noticed that you make fruit
faces on pancakes, but nights are long for me. You might be a morning
pony, but I am half-asleep.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: You think I don't get tired? I'm
exhausted! Oh, I apologize for not noticing flowers in a wall sconce.
But by the time I get to retire for the night, I can barely see
straight! Even so, I still make an effort to smile!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: Like smiling is so hard.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I-I-I'm sure that's not what Princess Luna meant to say.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: Is that what exhausts you? Smiling and being adored by everypony?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: And you have it so much worse, do
you?! You've spent your evenings flitting around giving ponies lovely
dreams! Oh, it sounds just awful!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [chuckles] Okay! I feel like we should step back, take a deep breath...
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: Don't presume to know what it is like to govern the dream realm!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: And yet you know exactly what it's like to be <i>me</i>?! Oh, please!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: <i>Enough!</i>
</dd><dd>[shimmering magic sounds]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: There! Now you'll know exactly what it's like to... be each other. [gulp]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: [gasps] What have you done?!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I... went with my gut?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: Switch our cutie marks back this instant!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: My apologies, your majesties! But I
can't, even if I wanted to. The spell lasts twenty-four hours. I-It may
have been extreme, but, uh, I think it's still a good idea?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: [serious] What?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Y-You said it yourselves! Neither of
you believes your sister knows how hard it is to be you. So this is your
 chance to prove it.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: Well, I could use an easy day followed by a good night's sleep.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: You can try. I haven't had an easy
day in, well, ever! But now, I get to sleep, and tonight will be a
breeze. All right, Starlight Glimmer. We will do this.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Good choice! Not that you had one. [chuckles]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b> and <b>Princess Luna</b>: [snort]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I'm gonna stop talking now.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [hyperventilating] You switched their cutie marks?! The actual princesses' cutie marks?!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [groans] I thought we moved past this. It was the right call! I hope.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [hyperventilating]
</dd><dd>[pounding on door]
</dd><dd><b>Guard</b>: Are you okay in there?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I-I'm good! Just, uh... reading an exciting book! [whispering to Twilight] He's gonna think I'm nuts!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: He's not the only one.
</dd><dd>[drawer opens]
</dd><dd>[drawer slams]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: As you can see, Celestia and I are switching places today.
</dd><dd>[confused murmuring]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: I assure you, I am more than capable of handling all of Celestia's, heh, duties. Dismissed.
</dd><dd>[nervous murmuring]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: So, what is first on my dear sister's to-do list?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: It says you have a few public appearances. Store openings, judging the royal rose contest... You know, that sort of thing.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: [chuckles] Oh, I knew today would be easy, but I didn't think it would be <i>that</i> easy.

<dl><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: "Princess Luna Unhappy with Student Fundraiser"? But I wasn't unhappy!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Um, you <i>are</i> scowling.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: Well, I-I didn't mean to! I've been
smiling all day! My cheeks hurt! I stopped for one second! And that's
when he took the picture!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Guess smiling all day isn't as easy as you thought?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: It says here that, because of me, the
school didn't raise enough funds to go on their field trip! I-I didn't
mean for that to happen!
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I know. But you can't dwell on that
now. According to the list, some delegates are about to arrive for a
luncheon. You need to dispel rumors of timberwolves in the White Tail
Woods. The nearby towns have been in a state of panic for weeks.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: B-B-But I have to fix this!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: You can't. You need to put on a brave face and help <i>these</i> ponies. It's what Celestia would do.
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: [deep breath, shouting] <i>Hello! Great news! There are no timberwolves!</i>
</dd><dd>[slam]
</dd><dd><b>Delegate Ponies</b>: No, there are definitely timberwolves!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: I'm sorry. But I couldn't stop thinking
about those poor students. Normally, I have all the time in solitude I
need to work through my problems at my own pace.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Well, your sister doesn't get that luxury.
</dd><dd><b>Mayor Cream Cheese</b>: [muffled] The princess will definitely side with me!
</dd><dd><b>Mayor Baltimare</b>: [simultaneous, muffled] Please see reason, Mayor Cream Cheese! I'm telling you, Baltimare...
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Ready for the town hall?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: [sighs]
</dd><dd><b>Mayor Cream Cheese</b> and <b>Mayor Baltimare</b>: [continued arguing]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Mayor Baltimare</b>: Glad that's settled.
</dd><dd><b>Mayor Cream Cheese</b>: [chuckles] And it only took three hours.
</dd><dd><b>Mayor Baltimare</b>: That got heated, didn't it?
</dd><dd><b>Mayor Cream Cheese</b>: Still on for golf?
</dd><dd><b>Mayor Baltimare</b>: Oh, absolutely.
</dd><dd><b>Mayor Cream Cheese</b>: [chuckles]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: You made it to the end of the day. Yay?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: Hmm? Oh. Yes, uh... [yawns] I'm just going to turn in, then. Good light, Starnight. [yawns]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Oh, hello, Starlight. I don't know about you, but I feel very well-rested. Where's Luna?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Um, uh, she already turned in for the night.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Did she now? It seems my duties were harder than my sister expected.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Moon raised! It's even easier than raising the sun. [chuckles] What's next?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [snoring]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Of course. Everypony's asleep at
night. Heh. Luna works alone... Oh, but it's nothing I can't handle. All
 I have to do is watch over Equestria, visit the dream realm, and
protect ponies in their nightmares. My list was three times as long!
[chuckles]
</dd><dd>[lightswitches clicking]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: All right. Everypony's asleep. You're
 talking to yourself, Celestia. Heh. But there's nopony else to talk to!
 [chuckles] Yet. I can talk to ponies in their dreams!
</dd><dd>[vooooom]
</dd><dd>[whimsical music]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Now, to save some ponies from their
nightmares. Which aren't real, so it shouldn't be too hard, right?
Right. Good call, Celestia! And I'm talking to myself again.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [screaming]
</dd><dd><b>Pancakes</b>: [in Celestia's voice] I care. I care. I care. [distorted] <i>I care.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [screaming] Ugh! No!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: This is big! Like, <i>really</i> big!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [yelping]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Starlight! I'm here now. Tell me what's wrong.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [panting] Going with my gut was the
wrong call! I was supposed to bring you two closer together! But I've
only driven you apart! If you two can't see why you need each other,
then—!
</dd><dd><b>Nightmare Moon</b>: Then I am back! [laughing evilly]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Don't worry, Starlight. I know how to handle Nightmare Moon.
</dd><dd><b>Daybreaker</b>: Yes! But can you handle... <i>me</i>?! [laughing evilly]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Daybreaker</b>: [laughing evilly]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: This can't be!
</dd><dd><b>Daybreaker</b>: If Luna can turn into Nightmare Moon, you
can absolutely turn into me — Daybreaker! The better, prettier, and more
 powerful version of you!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: No! I'll never turn into you!
</dd><dd><b>Daybreaker</b>: Deep inside, you know how powerful you are. You don't need Luna.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: That's not true! Even when we were apart, I knew I needed her!
</dd><dd><b>Daybreaker</b>: [laughs] Oh, please! You don't need anypony!
 You can do whatever you want. And all you have to do is get rid of
anypony who stands in your way!
</dd><dd>[magic zap]
</dd><dd><b>Daybreaker</b>: I never should've banished you to the moon! I should've destroyed you!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: No, you can't do that! Day, night, sun, moon — Equestria needs both of you!
</dd><dd>[magic zap]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Without balance, there's no harmony!
</dd><dd>[boom!]
</dd><dd><b>Nightmare Moon</b>: [growls]
</dd><dd><b>Daybreaker</b>: Who needs balance when you can have it all?! [laughs]
</dd><dd>[magic zap]
</dd><dd><b>Daybreaker</b>: Ugh!
</dd><dd><b>Nightmare Moon</b>: You can't get rid of me so easily, sister! Unless you plan on <i>smiling</i> me to smithereens!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: <i>Enough!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Daybreaker</b>: [laughs] I told you I was more powerful than you!
</dd><dd>[magic humming]
</dd><dd><b>Daybreaker</b>: Ugh. So much black. We get it. You're sad. You could really use some... <i>sun!</i>
</dd><dd>[flames roaring]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd>[shimmering magic sounds]
</dd><dd>[flames roaring]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b> and <b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [grunting]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: This is all my fault! I never should've gone on this mission! Now Equestria is doomed!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Dream Ponies</b>: [singsongy] That smile's too wide... It's obviously not real...
</dd><dd><b>Dream Pony</b>: Why don't you want us to go on our field trip?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: [through teeth gaps] I don't...!
</dd><dd>[teeth clattering]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: I mean, I do!
</dd><dd><b>Dream Ponies</b>: [singsongy] That smile's too wide... It's obviously not real...
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: Celestia! I'm so glad you're...!
</dd><dd>[magic zaps]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: [speaking normally] I've seen a lot, but I haven't seen <i>this</i> before.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: It's Starlight Glimmer's. She's afraid this is what will happen if we continue to fight!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [sobbing] What was I thinking?! I'm never going with my gut again!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: If you don't fix this soon, it could have a grave consequence on Starlight's psyche.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: But my magic isn't powerful enough! I thought if we worked together...!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: I have <i>your</i> magic, remember? It doesn't work in the dream realm. It has to be you!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Oh, Luna, I can't do this! I was
wrong! Your job is so incredibly hard! You have to battle nightmares and
 work in the darkness and do it all alone! It takes such a brave, strong
 pony to do what you do!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: And that pony is <i>you</i>. I walked a
day in your shoes. I thought all you had to do was smile and be adored
all the time, but I was wrong. There is so much more to it than that.
</dd><dd><b>Daybreaker</b>: [laughing maniacally]
</dd><dd>[magic zaps]
</dd><dd><b>Nightmare Moon</b>: [screams] Ugh!
</dd><dd><b>Daybreaker</b>: [laughing maniacally]
</dd><dd>[flames roaring]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Don't do this to each other!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: In order to defeat Daybreaker, you need only to trust in your strength as I do.
</dd><dd>[magic zaps]
</dd><dd><b>Daybreaker</b>: You can't destroy me! I'm everything you want to be!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: No, you're not! You are not real, and you will never exist <i>again!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Daybreaker</b>: [groans]
</dd><dd>[pop!]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: You did it!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Only because you were here. I don't know how you do this alone.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: So, um, did you talk to yourself?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Um, a little.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b> and <b>Princess Luna</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Is this really happening, or is this still a dream?
</dd><dd>[vooooom]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: Welcome back, sister! I know you had a long night, so I made you some pancakes!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Oh! Heh. H-How... eh, nice. Ahem. [chews, gags, gulps] They're... delicious. Heh. Thank you.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: [laughs] I know that face! They're not. I
 know you have to be perfect for everypony else, and you do an amazing
job. But you don't have to do it for me.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: In that case, they are terrible!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b> and <b>Princess Luna</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: I know!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: [sighs] But it means a lot that you tried. I love you, sister.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: I love you too.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: So... this <i>was</i> real. [yawns] Or... was it <i>not</i> real, and this just happened now and-and not in my dream? I'm so confused.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: [laughing] It's all real. It was the right call going with your gut.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: The map was wise to send you, Starlight. Nopony else would have been so bold as to do what you did.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: That's a nice way of saying I came dangerously close to messing everything up.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: It was just what we needed. The experience has made us closer than ever.
</dd><dd>[shimmering magic sounds]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Wait. I'm not doing this.
</dd><dd>[cutie mark ringing]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: I believe that one means your mission is complete.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Wow! I can't wait to tell Twilight!
</dd><dd>[teleportation zap]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [quickly] I already know! I mean, I
don't know everything. I just got here to bring you your toothbrush! So
this is just a friendly visit! Not interfering because I was worried! I
wasn't! I knew you could do it, and I'm so, so, so, so, so proud of you!
 <i>Tell me everything!</i> Start from after I hyperventilated, and don't leave out any details!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: Oh, uh, by the way, there's a field trip you need to make happen and a – ahem – timberwolf issue you need to address.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: W-What?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: Oh! Look! There's the sun! Time for me to turn in!
