</dd><dd><b>The Dazzlings</b>: [vocalizing]
</dd><dd><b>Aria Blaze</b>: [sighs] That was barely worth the effort, Adagio. I'm tired of fast food. I need a meal.
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: The energy in this world isn't the same as in Equestria. We can only gain so much power here.
</dd><dd><b>Aria Blaze</b>: Ugh! I wish we'd never been banished to this awful place!
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: [sarcastically] Really? I love it here!
</dd><dd><b>Sonata Dusk</b>: For realsies? Because I think this place is the worst.
</dd><dd><b>Aria Blaze</b>: I think <i>you're</i> the worst, Sonata.
</dd><dd><b>Sonata Dusk</b>: Oh, yeah? Well, I think <i>you're</i>â€”
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: Ergh! I'll tell you <i>one</i> thing, being stuck here with you two isn't making this world any more [through clenched teeth] <i>bearable</i>.
</dd><dd>[sonic rainboom]
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: [gasp] Did you feel that?! Do you know what that is?
</dd><dd><b>Sonata Dusk</b> and <b>Aria Blaze</b>: I 'unno.
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: It's Equestrian magic!
</dd><dd><b>Aria Blaze</b>: But this world doesn't <i>have</i> Equestrian magic.
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: It does <i>now</i>. And <i>we're</i> going to use it to make everyone in this pathetic little world adore us!

</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Uh, no thanks. We're good.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Oh. Okay.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Sunset Shimmer! Over here!
</dd><dd>[students whispering]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [sighs] I had no idea the whole school would be here.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Quite the eye-catching advertisement, if I do say so myself.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: And it smells like cake!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: It does? [sniff, sniff]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I used frosting instead of paste!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh, Fluttershy, you've got a little somethin', uh...
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Did I get it?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Heh, not exactly.
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: Good afternoon, students. I just
wanted to tell you all how pleased I am that so many of you are going to
 participate in the first ever Canterlot High School Musical Showcase!
</dd><dd>[students cheer]
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: This is a wonderful opportunity to
raise money for all our after-school programs here at CHS. So keep
working on those signs and posters. I think it's going to be one of the
most exciting events we've had at CHS since the Fall Formal.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Ugh! I am never gonna live that down.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: You were pretty bad at the Fall Formal.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: A demon. I turned into a raging she-demon.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: And tried to turn everyone here into teenage zombies for your own personal army!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, darling, you have us, and we've forgiven you for your past... ahem... booboos.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: To be honest, I'd say the whole experience brought everyone at Canterlot High closer than ever before!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: One, two, three!

<dl><dd><b>[The Rainbooms]</b>

<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [applauds]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [laughs] I still can't believe that happens when
 we play! Ooh! I've got to look into some new accessories! Something
that looks good in a longer ponytail. Ooh! Maybe some clip-on earrings
for when I get those adorable pony ears.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I just wonder <i>why</i> it happens. Princess Twilight took her crown back to Equestria. Shouldn't that mean she took all the magic back with her?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Who cares why it happens? It makes my band totally awesome!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh! <i>Your</i> band?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Duh! It was my idea to start the Rainbooms so we could be in the showcase. Plus I'm the lead singer and guitarist.
</dd><dd>[knock on door]
</dd><dd><b>Flash Sentry</b>: Uh, heard you outside. You guys are sounding really tight.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, we're getting there. Rarity's still
coming in a little late on the second verse, and Applejack's bass solo
could use a little work. They'll get it together in time for the
showcase.
</dd><dd><b>Flash Sentry</b>: Uh, I don't suppose any of our friends from, uh... out of town might come? Uh, it being a special charity event and all.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Sorry, Flash. I don't think Twilight's gonna be back at Canterlot High any time soon.
</dd><dd><b>Flash Sentry</b>: [laughs nervously] Oh, yeah. Okay. I just, you know, thought I'd ask. Uh, k-keep on rockin' it.
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well. [giggles] Someone is quite the smitten
kitten. [to Sunset Shimmer] Oh. Sorry. I always forget you and Flash
used to be an item.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: It's okay. Flash is a great guy and all, but I never really <i>liked-him</i> liked him. I was just using him to become more popular. Ugh! The old me really was just awful, wasn't she?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Mmm... horrid.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>, <b>Applejack</b>, <b>Fluttershy</b>: Mm-hmm, uhhh, etc.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yep!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: But the important thing is that you've turned yourself around.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Thanks, Applejack, but I'm not sure everyone else at CHS feels the same way.
</dd><dd>[P.A. system beeps]
</dd><dd><b>Vice Principal Luna</b>: Sunset Shimmer, please report to the main foyer.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Gotta run. I volunteered to show some
new students around the school. Thought it'd be good for them to get to
know the new me before they heard all the stuff about the old me.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: We've still got a few minutes before lunch starts. What do you say we do "Awesome As I Wanna Be"?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, Rainbow Dash? I was wondering if we could maybe play the song I wrote?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: We'll get to it.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh. Okay.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [plays chord]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Hi. Are you the girls I'm supposed to show around?
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: We are.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Canterlot High is a great school. You're really gonna love it.
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: Oh, yes, we really sense there's something... magical about this place.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: That's the science lab. Computer lab is
in there. Oh! We're having a big musical showcase this weekend! The
whole school is pretty much rallying around it.
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: [gasps] A <i>musical</i> showcase?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I'm sure since you're new, Principal Celestia would let you sign up if you're interested.
</dd><dd><b>Aria Blaze</b>: We have been known to sing from time to time.
</dd><dd><b>Sonata Dusk</b>: Hello? We sing, like, all the time! It's how we get people to do what we want.
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: [growls]
</dd><dd><b>Sonata Dusk</b>: Wha-What did I say?
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: What you <i>meant</i> to say was that being in a musical showcase sounds like a great way to meet other students.
</dd><dd><b>Sonata Dusk</b>: Ohhhh, yeah. Th-What she said I meant to say. That's what I meant. To say.
</dd><dd><b>Aria Blaze</b>: [scoffs] And what you <i>would</i> have said if you weren't the worst.
</dd><dd><b>Sonata Dusk</b>: <i>You</i> are!
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: You'll have to excuse them. They're idiots.
</dd><dd><b>Aria Blaze</b> and <b>Sonata Dusk</b>: Hmph.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [nervous laugh] Those are pretty. Where did youâ€”
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: [laughs] Sorry. These pendants mean an awful lot to us. We'd just hate for anything to happen to them.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[students chattering]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: So how was the tour?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I don't know. I mean, these girls, they were... There was something off about them.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Like, off like this? Or off like this? Or... Oh, oh! Likeâ€”
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Maybe we should just let her tell us.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: That's just it. I can't put my finger on
 it. They just acted sort of... strange around me. Maybe someone already
 talked to them. Told them about what I did. [sighs] So much for making a
 good first impression.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Uh-huh. Oh, that's probably not it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: This is it, girls. The moment we've been waiting for.
</dd><dd><b>Sonata Dusk</b>: Lunch?!
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: [groan] The chance to get our true Equestrian magic back.
</dd><dd><b>Sonata Dusk</b>: Oh. Right.
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: Our voices are just strong enough to make them want something so badly, they'll fight to get it.
</dd><dd><b>Aria Blaze</b>: So we're just gonna do what we always do?
Stir up some trouble and then feed off the negative energy?
[sarcastically] Some plan, Adagio.
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: It won't be the same as the times before!
 There is Equestrian magic here. Their negative energy will give us the
power we need to get this entire world to do our bidding.
</dd><dd><b>Sonata Dusk</b>: But we can get lunch after though, right? It's Taco Tuesday!
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: Just follow my lead.
</dd><dd><b>Aria Blaze</b>: Or my lead.
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: <i>My</i> lead!

</dd><dd>[students arguing]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ohhhh. They're <i>that</i> kind of "off".
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Those three are definitely in possession of some kind of dark magic. How else could you explain what happened back there?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Don't worry, y'all. We'll let Principal
Celestia know all about this and those girls will be kicked to the curb
in no time. Last thing she needs is another CHS event almost ruined by
some power-crazed lunatic. [to Sunset] Er, no offense.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [sighs] None taken.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: Dark magic? I find that very hard to believe. Those girls came into my office earlier and were absolutely delightful.
</dd><dd><b>Vice Principal Luna</b>: Ugh! Perhaps Sunset Shimmer is just
 eager to make someone else out to be a bad element, so that her actions
 at the Fall Formal will become old news.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I could see why you might think that, butâ€”
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That's <i>not</i> what's happening! We saw all of this go down in the cafeteria too!
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: Yes, but isn't your band supposed to be part of the Musical Showcase?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yes.
</dd><dd><b>Vice Principal Luna</b>: Perhaps you're all just worried that the Dazzlings will steal your spotlight.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: The "Dazzlings"?
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: It's the name of their musical
group. That's why they came by my office earlier â€“ to sign up for the
Showcase. Even sang a little song to Vice Principal Luna and I.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: They did?
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: Yes. And we think having a Battle of the Bands instead is a marvelous idea.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I can't believe they got to Principal Celestia and Vice Principal Luna too.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: They've gotten to everybody.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Not everybody!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Pinkie Pie's right. We were there when the
Dazzlings were singin' and we weren't affected. It was like we were
protected somehow.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: So let's take them down! It's not like we
haven't tangled with dark magic before and totally whooped its sorry
butt! Uh, no offense.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [sighs] None taken. Again.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: But that was when Twilight was here. There
may be some kind of magic inside us, but it only comes out when we play
music. I sure don't know how to use it to... whoop anybody's butt.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [sighs] If only we could get a message to
Twilight. Maybe she could tell us how to break the spell the Dazzlings
have cast on our friends.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, <i>that's</i> not gonna happen. The portal's closed.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [gasps] [gasps again]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: And I get the feeling they don't exactly have cell phones where she's from.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I may have an idea how we can get in touch with Princess Twilight!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[rustling]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: When I was Princess Celestia's student
back in Equestria, she gave me this. Even after I abandoned my studies, I
 held onto it. Deep down, I guess I knew I was making a big mistake, and
 I wanted to still have a way to reach out to her. Maybe it still works.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: That's a <i>book</i>, darling. What do you mean, "maybe still works"?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: It used to be that if I wrote something
here, it would appear in the pages of a book back in Princess Celestia's
 library. I get a message to <i>her</i>, then <i>she</i> can get a message to Princess Twilight.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: So what are you waiting for? Get to writing!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [sighs] Been a long time since I've written <i>these</i> words. "Dear Princess Celestia..."
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Delivery Pony</b>: Excuse me, Princess. Where do you want all these books from Princess Celestia?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The library. Third door on the left.
</dd><dd><b>Delivery Pony</b>: Even this one that's glowin' and vibratin'?
</dd><dd>[buzzing]
</dd><dd>[pages flipping]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: What is it, Twilight?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It looks like a message to Princess Celestia from my friends at Canterlot High.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: How is that even possible?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I have no idea, but it... sounds like they need my help.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The way Sunset Shimmer described them, I think these new girls sound an awful lot like... the sirens.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Not the sirens! [whispering loudly to Fluttershy] I don't actually know what that is!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The sirens were three beautiful but
dangerous creatures who had the power to charm ponies with their music.
But to maintain this power, they had to feed on the negativity and
distrust of others. The more of this negative energy they consumed, the
stronger their voices became, and the farther they could spread their
dark magic.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I don't think I like this story very much.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: If the sirens had their way, they
would have divided and conquered all of Equestria. But a certain Star
Swirl the Bearded wasn't having it. Rumor has it he found a way to
banish them to another world â€“ one where he believed their magic power
would be lost. That world must have been the one where my Canterlot High
 friends live.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: But Star Swirl must have sent them there ages ago. How come they're just surfacin' now?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I don't know. But if my hunch is right and it <i>is</i>
 the sirens who have come to Canterlot High, this spell they've cast is
just the beginning. My friends need me. I have to get back to them.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I hate to burst your bubble, Twilight, but
 the connection between their world and Equestria will still be totally
cut off for a super long time.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Okay, first of all, if there was
bubble-blowing going on, why wasn't I told about it?! And secondly, if
the connection is totally cut off, how was Sunset Shimmer able to get a
message to Twilight?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps] Pinkie, you're a genius!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yeah, I get that a lot. [to Rainbow Dash] Now about those bubbles...
</dd><dd>[handiwork noises]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: ...And the interval between the two
points is defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of the
separation between the points along three spatial dimensions.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Say what now?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Duh! She's gonna take the magic in here and
put it in there. That'll make the portal open up so that whenever she
wants to, she can go from here to there. There to here. Here to there.
Here there! Here there! Hereâ€”
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: We get the idea!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Now to see if it actually works.
</dd><dd>[magic noises]
</dd><dd><b>Main cast</b>: Ooooh...
</dd><dd>[electricity crackling]
</dd><dd><b>Main cast</b>: Ahhhhh...
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Don't suppose we could join you this time around?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Better not. It could make things pretty confusing if Canterlot High all of a sudden had <i>two</i> of all of you.
</dd><dd><b>Rest of main cast</b>: [agreeing]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: But <i>I</i> still get to go, right? There isn't another one of <i>me</i> at Canterlot High. And you never know if you might need your trusty assistant.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Mm-hmm.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Yes!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We won't be gone long.

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ready, Spike?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [cracks knuckles] [blows] [squeaks claws] Ready!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sighs] I'm starting to think she's not coming.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>, <b>Applejack</b>, <b>Rarity</b>, <b>Fluttershy</b>, <b>Rainbow Dash</b>, and <b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Twilight!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oof. I'm back.
</dd><dd><b>Rest of main cast</b>: [greeting Twilight]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And I've got some bad news about those new girls.
</dd><dd><b>Rest of main cast</b>: [worried reaction]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, I do hate that you had to return at a time of crisis. There's so much catching up to do!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: For starters, a certain blue-haired guitar player was just askin' about you.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [excitedly] Flash Sentry was asking about me?! [clears throat] Isn't that nice? [sips milkshake]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Perhaps you would give us just the slightest bit of gossip from your world?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: She's got an official title now. [imitates fanfare] The Princess of Friendship!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Wow, that's really impressive. Guess you really <i>were</i> Princess Celestia's prized pupil.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: She's even got her own castle!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: A castle?! You have your own castle?!? Eh... [clears throat] Ooh, uh, lovely.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What's new here? I mean, besides your school becoming the target of dangerous magical creatures from Equestria?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, so, that isn't exactly the <i>only</i> strange thing that's happened since you left. Pretty sweet, huh? It happens to all of us when we play.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hmm. My crown was returned to
Equestria, but some of its magic must have remained here at Canterlot
High. Now that we're all back together, we can use that magic on the
sirens. Just like when we were able to use it on Sunset Shimmer when she
 turned into that horrifyingly awful winged monster! No offense.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [disgruntled] None taken. Heh. I'm used to it.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: They'll never even know what hit 'em! [karate yells]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: We've got nothin' to worry about now that Twilight's back.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, I'm pretty sure <i>I</i> could find something to worry about. But it won't be the sirens.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The sooner we do this, the better. Any idea where the Dazzlings might be?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [sips milkshake] [sighs] There's a big party
 tonight for all the bands who signed up to be in the showcase! That
would include the Dazzlings.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Looks like we've got a party to crash.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [squee]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[students arguing]
</dd><dd><b>Flash Sentry</b>: [sighs] I'm gonna get more punch!
</dd><dd>[crash!]
</dd><dd><b>Flash Sentry</b>: Twilight?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Eh, bumped, into, always, doing?
</dd><dd><b>Flash Sentry</b>: What are you doing here? You came back for the big competition, right?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Something like that.
</dd><dd><b>Flash Sentry</b>: Huh. Not that there's gonna be any <i>real</i> competition. No one here wants this as bad as <i>my</i> band does!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Can you excuse me for just a minute?
</dd><dd>[students' arguing becomes louder]
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: [mock surprise] Oh, no! No one's
mingling! It's like there's some kind of underlying tension that could
bubble to the surface at any minute!
</dd><dd><b>Sonata Dusk</b>: It's the fruit punch, isn't it? I <i>knew</i> I used too much grape juice!
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: It's <i>not</i> the fruit punch! It's us!
</dd><dd><b>Aria Blaze</b>: But the punch is awful, too.
</dd><dd><b>Sonata Dusk</b>: What do <i>you</i> know about good fruit punch?
</dd><dd><b>Aria Blaze</b>: More than you!
</dd><dd><b>Sonata Dusk</b>: Do not!
</dd><dd><b>Aria Blaze</b>: Do too!
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: This is just the kickoff party, girls. Imagine what a tizzy they'll be in by the time the Battle of the Bands starts.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: There isn't going to be a Battle of
the Bands! We're gonna make sure of that! Alright, girls, let's do this!
 Friendship is magic!
</dd><dd>[awkward silence]
</dd><dd>[someone coughs]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, weren't there rainbows and lasers and stuff last time?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I don't understand. We're all together again. Why isn't this working?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: You, uh... really need to go ahead and do that whole "magic of friendship" thing now.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm trying, Spike. I thought the six
of us standing together against the sirens would bring out the magic we
needed to defeat them. That's what happened before.
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: Talk about throwing down the gauntlet!
This group is obviously serious about winning! A little cocky though,
aren't they? Claiming there won't really be a battle. Seems they think
they've already got this thing all locked up.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: Not if the Great and Powerful Trrrrrixie has anything to do with it!
</dd><dd><b>Flash Sentry</b>: Whatever, Trixie! We're the best band at CHS!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: No! The Crusaders are gonna win!
</dd><dd>[students arguing even louder]
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: I think we may have found what we're looking for. Or rather, it found us.
</dd><dd><b>Aria Blaze</b>: [slaps herself]
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: Magic!! Don't you see?! Everyone else has fallen under our spell. But not <i>these</i> girls. These girls are special.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It doesn't make any sense. I should
have been able to create the spark that would help us break their spell.
 That's how it worked before.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: But to defeat me, you drew magic from the crown I was wearing. The sirens' magic comes from their music. So maybe <i>you</i> have to use the same kind of magic to defeat <i>them</i>. Or... maybe not.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No. I think you're onto something.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Really?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's when you play music that you transform now, right?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Yup. Ears, tails, the whole shebang.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: So maybe the way to use that magic to defeat the sirens is by playing a musical counter-spell!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: You mean like a song?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Uh-huh. And in order to free everyone who's been exposed to the sirens' spell, we'll need them all to hear it.
</dd><dd><b>Rest of main cast</b>: Hmmm...
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [gasps] The band competition! That's the next time we can be certain everyone will be in the same place at the same time.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Guess the Rainbooms <i>are</i> the band to beat.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: And I believe <i>you</i>, Twilight, just became the Rainbooms' newest member.
</dd><dd><b>Rest of main cast</b>: [laughing and cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: So what do you wanna play? Triangle? [ding] Sousaphone? [fwomp!] Theremin? [plays theremin] Soooo magical.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I might take a little too long to learn how to play something with these. I'll just sing.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Like, as in, <i>lead</i> singer? Cuz that's usually <i>my</i> gig. This being my band and all.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: It's <i>our</i> band! And, of course, as lead singer. She's the one with the magical know-how to help us pull this thing off.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Okay, yeah, that's cool. I'll just use this as a chance to hone my already insanely good lead guitar skills.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's only temporary. And we don't have
 to win the Battle of the Bands. We just have to perform during the
first round of the competition.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Let's get to learning that musical counter-spell!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, that's just it. I don't <i>know</i> any.
</dd><dd><b>Rest of main cast</b>: Awww...
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But I'm sure I could figure out how to <i>write</i> one.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Totally! Twilight can write a spell like it's <i>no</i>body's business. That's pretty much how she got to become a princess in Equestria.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Technically, I helped <i>finish</i> a spell. And there was a little more to it than that, Spike.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Yeah, whatever.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I've got this. [to Spike] C'mon!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Where're you goin'?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, last time we were here, Spike and I spent the night in the library.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Are you crazy?! We're besties now! Slumber party at my house!

</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hey! I was about to beat you!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I doubt it. So, Twilight, how is that counter-spell comin'?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Huh? Oh, uh, good. Great. Thanks for
letting me use your notebook, Fluttershy. I really like the song you
wrote for the Rainbooms.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Thanks. [sighs] Hopefully one day, we'll get a chance to play it.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hey!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Twilight, I think I speak for all of us when I say I don't know what we would have done if you hadn't come back to help us.
</dd><dd><b>Rest of main cast</b>: Uh-huh.

<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [spits] No. <i>That's</i> not gonna work.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Hey, Twilight. You're up late.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Just looking over the counter-spell. We only get one shot at this. It has to be perfect.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: We really are lucky you're here.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That's what everyone keeps telling me.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Who could possibly need this much
whipped cream? Must be nice to have everyone always looking to you for
answers to their problems... instead of waiting for you to <i>cause</i> a problem.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Just because everyone expects something from you doesn't mean it's guaranteed to happen.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Well, that doesn't stop them from expecting it.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Which only makes things harder because the last thing you want to do is...
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b> and <b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: ...let everybody down.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Waaah!
</dd><dd><b>Maud</b>: Boulder was hungry.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I still can't get over the fact that she's related to Pinkie Pie.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You and me both!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [yawns] I better get some sleep. Good
luck with the counter-spell. Not that you'll need it. This must be
nothing compared with the stuff you're expected to deal with as a
princess in Equestria.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Sunset Shimmer? ...Never mind. It's not important. No, I have to be able to do this. I <i>have</i> to.

</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Nnope.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [whimpers]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I think it's pretty obvious what's going wrong with this counter-spell.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: You're turnin' what should be the chorus into a five-minute guitar solo?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I have to pick up the slack <i>some</i>how! Are you guys even trying?!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I'm trying.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's fine. [nervous laugh] It'll be fine. One more time from the top!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Or, perhaps we could take a short break, try on
some of the wardrobe choices I've put together? I'm particularly fond of
 this one. Eh, of course we could always go with something a bit more
modern.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: We're tryin' to save our school here. Enough with the costumes!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [robotic voice] Oh, you can <i>never</i> have enough costumes!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: She just wants to make things fun! Isn't that what being in a band supposed to be? [plays rimshot angrily]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: You don't have <i>time</i> for any of this! You're supposed to check in at the Battle of the Bands in fifteen minutes!
</dd><dd><b>Main cast</b>: [gasps] Oh, no!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What? But it's not ready! If we play
our counter-spell in the first round and it doesn't work, the sirens
will know what we're up to and make sure we don't get a chance to play
it again!
</dd><dd>[screeeeeech!]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Then we'll have to <i>buy</i> ourselves some time so you can keep workin' on it!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: But how do you propose we do <i>that</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: We compete in the Battle of the Bands for
real! I take over lead vocals again and we stay alive until the finals!
We unleash the counter-spell <i>then</i>! [to Twilight] You'll have figured it out by finals, right?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Of course she will. Twilight Sparkle's never met a problem she couldn't solve. Right, Twilight?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [not so confidently] Right.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Then let's go win us a Battle of the Bands!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: Welcome to the first ever Canterlot
High School Battle of the Bands. I believe I speak for everyone when I
say it is by far the greatest thing we have ever done here at this
school!
</dd><dd>[students cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: We are so glad our three newest students encouraged us to turn this event into something exciting!
</dd><dd><b>Vice Principal Luna</b>: But, as this is now a competition, we can only choose one winner. Who is it going to be?
</dd><dd>[students arguing]
</dd><dd><b>Male Student</b>: You're the worst thing to happen!
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: You feel that, girls? Our true power is being restored.
</dd><dd><b>Aria Blaze</b> and <b>Sonata Dusk</b>: [giggling]
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: And that's <i>before</i> we've tapped into the strongest magic here.
</dd><dd><b>Aria Blaze</b>: But the Rainblossoms, or whatever they're called, aren't under our spell. How exactly are we supposed to get to their magic?
</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: The Rainbooms are just as capable of
falling apart as anyone else. They just need a little... push in the
wrong direction. I have a feeling everyone here is going to be lining up
 to give them a shove.

</dd><dd><b>Crowd</b>: [booing]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Guess that explains why these were so special to them.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Without those pendants and the magic you brought here from Equestria, they're just three harmless teenage girls.
</dd><dd><b>Flash Sentry</b>: Rainbooms rule! That was amazing!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b> and <b>Main cast sans Twilight</b>: [giggling]
</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: You may have vanquished the Dazzlings,
but you will never have the amazing, show-stopping ability of the Great

</dd><dd><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b>: Trixie's okay!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You know, Twilight is going back to

<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Sure wish you could stay longer.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Me too. But I have responsibilities in
 Equestria that I have to get back to. Its citizens need me. But now I
can go through the portal whenever I need to. This isn't goodbye. It's
just goodbye 'til next time. Ready?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Ready!

<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [voiceover] <i>Dear Princess Twilight,</i>

still have a lot to learn about friendship. Hope you don't mind if I
write to you for advice when I need it.</i>
