</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: She doesn't have her cutie mark. Of course she'll wanna join the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I'm just so excited I could burst!

</dd><dd><b>Babs Seed</b>: Yeah... uh... a surprise?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: I give you... the Cutie Mark Crusaders Clubhouse!
</dd><dd><b>Babs Seed</b>: The Cutie Mark Crusaders?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: A club devoted to helping ponies get their cutie marks! We're its founding members.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Technically, we're its <i>only</i> members.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: But we're always looking to expand, and you seem like the perfect candidate!
</dd><dd><b>Babs Seed</b>: I do?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Well, yeah, since you don't have a cutie mark and all.
</dd><dd><b>Babs Seed</b>: Oh, yeah... [blows] That...

</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Uh, could you excuse us for a moment?
</dd><dd><b>Babs Seed</b>: Sure...
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: [hushed] Thought she'd be more impressed.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [hushed] She's from Manehattan. If we wanna impress her, we need to really wow her!
</dd><dd><b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: Hmmmm.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps] [hushed] The float! She can ride with us on our Summer Harvest Parade float!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: [hushed] That's perfect! This really is a good spot for thinking up great ideas.
</dd><dd><b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: Mm-hmm.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Here it is! The official Cutie Mark Crusaders float for the Summer Harvest Parade!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: As a member of the Cutie Mark Crusaders, you'd be able to ride on it with us! It'd be totally fun.
</dd><dd><b>Babs Seed</b>: [laughs nervously]
</dd><dd><b>Diamond Tiara</b>: More like <i>funny</i>...

</dd><dd><b>Silver Spoon</b>: What <i>is</i> that thing, a giant <i>orange</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Diamond Tiara</b> and <b>Silver Spoon</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: It's a pumpkin.
</dd><dd><b>Diamond Tiara</b>: More like a lame-kin.
</dd><dd><b>Silver Spoon</b>: [laughs]
</dd><dd><b>Diamond Tiara</b>: Who's the new blank flank?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: She's mah cousin, Babs. She's from Manehattan!
</dd><dd><b>Diamond Tiara</b>: Manehattan, huh? Well, I guess you have that going for you.
</dd><dd><b>Silver Spoon</b>: Suppose you're gonna join their little club? What's it called? The [mockingly] Cutie Mark Crusaders?
</dd><dd><b>Babs Seed</b>: [blows] More like the Cutie Mahk <i>Crybabies</i>! [derisive chuckle]

</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: When ah tell Applejack–
</dd><dd><b>Babs Seed</b>: You gonna tell Applejack what?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: W-well, y'know, uh...
</dd><dd><b>Babs Seed</b>: What're you, a snitch?
</dd><dd><b>Diamond Tiara</b>: Come on, Babs, you should hang with us! Y'know, the cool ponies, not these babies!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: What... just happened?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I think Babs just went to the dark side.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: We have to tell Applejack!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: No! We're <i>not</i> snitches!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Yeah! And we're not <i>babies</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Then... why do I feel like crying?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I still can't believe she ruined our pumpkin float.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: I still can't believe I'm related to such a big stinkin' bully!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [sighs] What are we gonna do?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: We're gonna build a new float, that's what.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Why bother? She'll probably just ruin that one, too.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: [sighs]
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: We could always tell Applejack.
</dd><dd><b>Babs Seed</b>: [echoing] What are you, a snitch?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b> and <b>Scootaloo</b>: No!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [groans]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: We're not gonna be a bunch of tattle-tales!
 Besides, she's only here a couple of weeks. We'll just avoid her like
the plague until she goes home.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Avoid her. Yeah, how hard can that be?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>[Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo]</b>

<dl><dd><b>[Apple Bloom]</b>
<dl><dd>First, we thought that Babs was so really, really sweet
</dd><dd>A new friend to have, and it seemed like such a treat
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>[Scootaloo]</b>
<dl><dd>But then, we found the truth; she's just a bully from the east
</dd><dd>She went from Babs, yeah, to a bully and a beast
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>[Apple Bloom]</b>
<dl><dd>Everywhere we turn, she's just a step ahead
</dd></dl>

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>[Apple Bloom]</b>
<dl><dd>Hiding from a bully, we know it isn't right
</dd><dd>But the Cutie Mark Crusaders, we aren't lookin' for a fight
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>[Scootaloo]</b>
<dl><dd>Oh, she'll go home soon, and then we'll have some peace again
</dd><dd>But for now, we're staying out of her way 'til then
</dd></dl>

</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: That's not fair, Babs! We never did anything to you!
</dd><dd><b>Babs Seed</b>: And let's keep it that way. Now scram, crybabies!

</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [blows]
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Ooh!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Luster dust from Sugarcube Corner. They use it for decorating cakes.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: That must be what Rarity uses on her emergency edible boots!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: The gears and bands for the moving mechanism, my tools and stuff... Did you bring the <i>thing</i> from the <i>place</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: What's that?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Granny Smith's kitchen timer.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: What's that for?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [sing-song voice] You'll see! [giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: C'mon, y'all, let's get to it. We only got a
 few hours before mornin', and this thing has to look so good, Babs

</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: [hushed] The timer set?
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Teach her to fool with the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Y'all are letting Babs ride in your golden apple float?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Yeah. We thought she deserved to be the... center of attention.
</dd><dd><b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: [giggling]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, that's just super sweet of y'all,
makin' Babs feel so special. Y'know, after all the heartache she's been
havin' in Manehattan.
</dd><dd>[pop]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Heartache?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, I didn't say nothin' 'cause I didn't
want her to feel singled out, but there's been some bullies back in
Manehattan just been teasin' her to pieces for her blank flank.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: T-t-t-teased?
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: B-Bullies?!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Yup. She came up to the farm to get away from all her problems back home. I'm so proud of y'all. You've done a good deed.
</dd><dd>[balloons deflating]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: So <i>that's</i> why she jumped in when Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon started giving us a hard time.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: She didn't want to be bullied like at home, so she decided to <i>be</i> a bully instead!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: And now <i>we've</i> turned into bullies too!
</dd><dd><b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: What do we do?!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[crowd cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Diamond Tiara</b>: Nice float, Babs.
</dd><dd><b>Babs Seed</b>: Snagged it from those whiny baby blank flanks.

</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Are y'all okay?
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Yeah... we're fine.

</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: [sighs] About that...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Babs Seed</b>: I don't get it! I saw it all happen! You pushed me out just when the float was about to head into the lake!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Except... <i>we</i> were the reason it was headed into the lake.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: We booby trapped the float.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Y'see Babs, we were tryin' to get you back for bein' a big bully...
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: But then Applejack told us about how you were being bullied back in Manehattan.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: And we figured out you were just doing it to avoid getting picked on in Ponyville. But, by then... <i>we</i> were the ones being bullies. And... Oh, <i>why does life have to be so ironic</i>?!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Guess what we're trying to say is...
</dd><dd><b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: We're sorry.
</dd><dd><b>Babs Seed</b>: [blows] I'm sorry too.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [sighs] Y'know, <i>this all could've been avoided if y'all just came to me in the very beginning.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: That's what <i>I</i> kept on saying!
</dd><dd><b>Babs Seed</b>: So... can we... start over?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Definitely.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Yeah.
