</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, Twilight?
</dd><dd>[knock on door]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [barks excitedly]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Twilight! The bus for Camp Everfree leaves in ten minutes!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, no-no-no-no-no! I can't believe I overslept!
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Me neither. That's not like you.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I know!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Don't you have a super-annoying alarm clock that goes [imitates alarm clock buzzer]?
</dd><dd>[alarm clock buzzer]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: It's gonna be fine. We'll help you pack.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [pants]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [sighs] We're gonna be out in the woods. When is she gonna need that?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: If we were going to the moon, I'd insist she packed an evening gown. One never knows, darling.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Lemme just get changed.
</dd><dd><b>The Equestria Girls</b>: Midnight Sparkle?!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: How is this possible? Sunset Shimmer helped me defeat you at the Friendship Games!
</dd><dd><b>Midnight Sparkle</b>: You and your friends can never truly defeat me! [maniacal laughter]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>, <b>Rarity</b>, and <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [scream]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b> and <b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [scream]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b> and <b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [scream]
</dd><dd><b>Midnight Sparkle</b>: Midnight Sparkle's a part of you! I'll
 always be there waiting in the darkest shadows of your mind! I'll be
back, Twilight! And <i>this</i> time, I won't stop until I have <i>all</i> the magic!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Stop!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Twilight, wake up!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: We <i>can't</i> stop, silly! We're not there yet!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Hey, are you okay?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Heh. I'm fine.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: We are gonna have so much fun! We're gonna roast marshmallows and eat marshmallows and sleep on marshmallow pillows!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, probably not gonna do that.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Maybe <i>you're</i> not.
</dd><dd>[squeak]
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: Attention, students, we're almost
there. But before we arrive, we just wanted to say how proud we are of
you for raising enough money to go on this class field trip.
</dd><dd><b>Vice Principal Luna</b>: When we were your age, we made some of our favorite memories in these woods, and we're sure you will, too.
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: Now who's excited for Camp Everfree?!
</dd><dd><b>Students</b>: [cheering]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>[All]</b>
<dl><dd>Will you be lost by time or be part of history?
</dd><dd>Will your story be told or remain a mystery?
</dd><dd>Will they sing your song, telling all that you have done?
</dd><dd>Time to make your choice, only you can be the one

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Will you do something great with the time that you have here?

</dd><dd>Hey!﻿
</dd></dl>
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Isn't Camp Everfree just beautiful? I can't wait until we have our first nature walk.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I definitely wanna go on one of those.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: You wanna see all the adorable woodland creatures, too?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Yeah! Specifically squirrels. More specifically, so I can <i>chase</i> 'em! [barks, pants]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I'm just lookin' forward to roughin' it. I'm gonna make my own shelter, forage for food...
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, you know they provide us with food and tents, right?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Yup! Still gonna forage though.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [sighs] I'm just after some R&amp;R. The past year has all been a bit too much for my tastes.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I'll say! We fought three evil sirens who tried to hypnotize everybody with their singing, one <i>ridiculously</i> competitive rival school, and two demon friends! [to Sunset and Twilight] Uh, heh-heh, no offense.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: None taken. [to Twilight] You'll get used to it.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Yep. Canterlot High has become a regular
magic magnet. Gonna be nice gettin' away to a place where we don't have
to worry about that kinda stuff.
</dd><dd><b>Flash Sentry</b>: Here you go, Twilight.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Thanks. It's... Flash, right?
</dd><dd><b>Flash Sentry</b>: Yup, that's me! And you're you. And we don't know each other very well. [muttering] Cool story, bro.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Right. I guess I'll... see you around.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: You know how there's that girl who looks
 just like you when she's here but lives in another dimension and she's a
 pony princess?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Uh-huh.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Flash kinda had a... thing for her.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh.
</dd><dd>[P.A. feedback]
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: [over P.A.] Hey, everyone! If you could
start heading to the courtyard, that would be rad! It's time to start
the best week of camp ever!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[campers conversing]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [barking]
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: [amplified] Hi, everyone! Welcome to
Camp Everfree! I'm Gloriosa Daisy, your camp director! Think of me as
your friendly camp and nature guide. And this is my brother, Timber
Spruce!
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: Think of me as that awesome guy... who should always be invited to fun things.
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: We aim to please, so before we hand out
our tent assignments, we'd like to hear from all of you. You're free to
do whatever you like here.
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: Uh, except hike near the rock quarry. That's off-limits.
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: Y-Yes, but otherwise, your options are wide open. So what activities will make this the very best week of your lives ever?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ooh! Rock climbing!
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: Done!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Archery!
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: Of course!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Tetherball!
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: Naturally!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Rainbow, I know you're excited, but maybe give somebody else a chance to make a suggestion.
</dd><dd><b>Bulk Biceps</b>: Arts and crafts! My mom... needs new pot holders.
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: I'll supply the looms!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Cookie decorating! [slurps]
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: Ooh, I do make a mean sugar cookie.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Early morning nature walks?
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: With walking sticks for everyone!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Ooh! Me! Oh, uh... a fashion show! Where I design the most fabulous camp looks inspired by today's hottest trends <i>and</i> have them modeled by my classmates in a gorgeous outdoor setting!
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: A camp tradition!
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: We have literally never done that.
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: I'll be taking requests the rest of the
time you're here, so if there's anything you'd like to do, anything you
need, just ask.
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: What about the camp gift? That was <i>my</i> favorite Camp Everfree tradition.
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: The camp gift! Of course!
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: [whispering] Really?
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: [whispering] Yes, really.
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: [whispering] Well, I just thought—
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: [whispering] Then you thought wrong!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Anyone else picking up on a little tension between Gloriosa and her brother?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b> and <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ehhh...
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: A little.
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: Every year, campers work together to
create something useful. A gift for future campers. Working toward this
common goal is key to forming the strong bonds that will last well
beyond your time here at camp! [hushed] Which is why it's so important.
[out loud] This gazebo was a gift from last year's group. Oh, oh, oh,
and the totem pole and the sundial were also made by campers!
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: The sundial was <i>our</i> year's gift!
</dd><dd><b>Vice Principal Luna</b>: [coughing] Even though "some people" thought it was a little impractical, since the sundial can't be used at night.
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: [chuckles] You all seem like a-a really amazing group. So I'm certain you'll come up with something inspiring to leave behind.
</dd><dd>[campers cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: Speaking of leaving things behind, now's the time when we give out tent assignments so you can leave your heavy bags behind.
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: Uh, girls will be getting their assignments from Timber. Guys, you're with me.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh, boy! Hmm... Yay! I'm in the Emerald Tent!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Ooh, me, too!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Aquamarine.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Me, too!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Yee-hoo!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh, yeah!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I got Amethyst.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Sapphire.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Me, too! I mean, I'm assuming I am.
Heh-heh. Technically, sapphires aren't just blue. Heh-heh. They can be
pink, purple, yellow...
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: Yeah, but they're mostly blue. That's why they're named after the Latin word <i>sapphirus</i>.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: [whispering] That means "blue".
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [whispering] I know. But did you know that sapphires are just rubies without chromium?
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: No. But did you know that Sapphire Tent is the best one?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No. Why's that?
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: Because you're in it.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, I bet you say that to all the campers.
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: Not true. [to Bulk Biceps] You're in the Ruby Tent? Ha! That's the worst one!
</dd><dd><b>Bulk Biceps</b>: Aw, man!
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: I'm just jokin', buddy. Ruby Tent is great. It's like a sapphire but <i>with</i> chromium.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: But the Ruby and Coral Tents do look an
awful lot alike to the undiscerning eye. I better show you where it is.
[to Twilight] See ya around.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b> and <b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [giggling]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Heh. Nothin'.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Ooh! That was adorable!
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: [blows whistle] Okay, everyone, go get
settled in. We'll be meeting at the docks in fifteen minutes to go over
some camp safety rules. Let me know if you need anything!
</dd><dd><b>Filthy Rich</b>: I need somethin'.
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: Filthy Rich! So nice to see you. [whispering] What are you doing here?! Camp is just getting started!
</dd><dd><b>Filthy Rich</b>: Just takin' in the scenery, Gloriosa Daisy. It's so... hmm... relaxin'.
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: Well, you can look around when camp is over. Now, if you don't mind...
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Filthy Rich</b>: Fine.
</dd><dd>[limo drives away]
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: Filthy Rich is, uh, an alumni of the
camp. He likes to check on his old stomping grounds every now and again.
 But enough about him. Find your tents and put away your things. We've
got the best week of camp ever to begin!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [sighs] I'm all for learning safety rules, but I
do hope I can get started on my designs for the camp fashion show sooner
 rather than later.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Huh. I still can't believe you talked
Gloriosa into havin' a fashion show. We're in the middle of the woods,
for cryin' out loud! We're s'posed to be roughin' it!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: It's clear from Gloriosa's own wardrobe that she
 appreciates a well put together look. Even if we are in the "middle of
the woods".
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Fair enough. Just as long as you don't put me in one of your fancy pants outfits. ...You're gonna, aren't ya?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: No. Yes! [chuckles] Don't worry, darling. It'll absolutely speak to your personal sense of style...
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [spookily] Oooooooooohhhh.... [normal] That was weird back there, right? With that guy, Filthy Rich?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Huh? Oh. Uh, I guess so.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I just have this feeling that Gloriosa's hiding something. Her brother is pretty cute, though, huh?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: He's okay.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Ooooh, <i>now</i> look who's trying to hide something.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No, I'm not!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Hey, you okay? You seemed a little freaked out on the bus earlier.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Probably had another one of her nightmares.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm fine. I mean, what do I have to
complain about? Ever since I transferred here, everyone from CHS has
been really nice and accepting, especially considering what happened at
the Friendship Games.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: That wasn't your fault. Principal Cinch
is the one who encouraged you to try and use all that magic to win the
Games for Crystal Prep. You weren't ready to have that kind of power.
But it's over now. And if there's any group that's gonna forgive you for
 something that happened in the past, trust me, it's this one.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You guys comin' or what?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Be right there! I just wanna put on some sunscreen. Huh. I coulda <i>sworn</i> I packed it.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Found it!
</dd><dd>[levitation noises]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Did you? How is this possible?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I can't believe this. It's...

<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Are you kidding? This is great! I mean,
we've all ponied up before, gotten the whole ears and wings and tail
thing, shot magical rainbow lasers, but nothing like this has ever
happened! How did you do it?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I don't know! Maybe I didn't. Maybe it's her!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Her who?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Nothing. Never mind. Can we just not
talk about it? And could you please not bring this whole levitating
thing up to the others?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Why not?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You heard Applejack. This is supposed
to be the place where everyone can get away from magic. I don't want
them to know I brought some crazy new kind with me.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: If you really don't want me to, I won't say anything.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I really don't.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Okay, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing! [grunting] [sighs] [grunting] [sighs]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I think you're just gonna have to pick it up.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Awww.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: [thinking] —show up like that!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: What did you say?
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: I... didn't say anything. Just here to make sure everyone was headed over to the docks! Did you need something?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Nope.
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: Because if there is anything I can do to make this week the best week ever, you just let me know. I've got this!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Thanks, I'm good. [to Spike] People that chipper make me nervous.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: This is gonna be so much fun!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I guess not all people.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, it's beautiful, isn't it? It looks like a diamond shining in the sun!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: It is lovely out here. The fresh air, the cool breeze, the birds that land on your finger.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I think that only happens to you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: Lake activities are available every day until sunset, so if you want to canoe, sail, windsurf, or swim, just let me know.
</dd><dd>[ducks quacking]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Aren't they just the cutest?
</dd><dd>[wood splinters]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [yelps]
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: Whoa! I know I'm charming, but you don't have to fall for me.
</dd><dd><b>Flash Sentry</b>: [sighs] Guess I can't get too jealous, right? After all, she isn't <i>my</i> Twilight. Not that the other Twilight was mine! But we were... you know.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Yeah. I get it. But your Twilight is a
princess in Equestria. Hate to break it to you, but that's where she's
gonna spend most of her time.
</dd><dd><b>Flash Sentry</b>: So you're saying I just need to get over her?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Kinda, yeah.
</dd><dd><b>Flash Sentry</b>: Ouch. You're not pulling any punches.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Not really my style. Sorry.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Vice Principal Luna</b>: This is a safety hazard. I suggest we close down the dock for the remainder of the camp.
</dd><dd><b>Students</b>: [complaining]
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: Oh, I'm sure it won't have to be for the remainder of camp. Just needs to be patched up a bit. I've got this!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Huh. Or maybe <i>we</i> do! If you ask me,
this whole dock needs to go. [thump] Building a new one could be our
camp gift. Sure, it would benefit us, but a nice new dock would benefit
future campers, too.
</dd><dd><b>Students</b>: [cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: I don't know. It's an awful lot of work. I
 wouldn't want you guys to miss out on doing other fun camp stuff
because you're so busy building a dock for <i>future campers</i>.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I hear what you're saying, Timber, but
we're Canterlot Wondercolts. We've got a reputation to uphold! And there
 was no way we were gonna leave this place without contributing the most
 awesome camp gift ever! I'm with AJ. Building a new dock is definitely
it! What do you guys think?
</dd><dd><b>Students</b>: [cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: [to Timber] Looks like it's settled, then.
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: [to Gloriosa] Looks like it.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: That's some tension, all right.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We can reinforce the foundation.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Make it nice and sturdy.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: And we can add a wood-carved sign that says "Camp Everfree".
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: And little boxes with food so you can feed the ducks and fishies.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh, we'll add lanterns so you can see at night!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [gasps] It's stunning! And will make an absolutely perfect runway for my camp fashion show!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: More importantly, it will be a great place for docking canoes and feeding the wildlife.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, you say "tomato", I say "perfect place to showcase glamorous boho-chic stylings".
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What do you guys think?
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: It's going to be a lot of work, but we can do it!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yes! Adult supervision!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Huh, nice hammer. Where did you get it?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, duh. The toolbox?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hah, that's cool. I made mine.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ugh.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Making lanterns out of solar-powered garden lights! Pretty crafty there, Timber!
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: You think that's crafty? You should see my macaroni art. I'm like the Picasso of noodles.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: All right, now. You've made a lot of
 progress, but it's going to be getting dark soon. We can pick this up
tomorrow between our other camp activities.
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: Everyone, get cleaned up, and we'll gather by the fire pit at eight to share s'mores and scary stories!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>S'mores!</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: ...And that's when she looked down and realized
she was wearing purple socks with a burgundy dress! [screaming] Purple
and burgundy, darlings! The same color family! [screaming]
</dd><dd><b>Students</b>: [murmuring]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh... that was a terrifying story.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [chuckles] Yeah, I'm terrified she'll try to tell it again.
</dd><dd><b>Vice Principal Luna</b>: [clears throat] Anyone else have a spooky story?
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: I have one. But I'm warning you, you might as well hug a friend now. That's how scary it is!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [whimpers]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, dear.
</dd><dd><b>Bulk Biceps</b>: [clattering teeth]
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: It's time I told you about the legend of Gaea Everfree.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: [narrating] Many years ago, my
great-grandparents came to this forest. Seeing its beauty, they decided
that it would be the perfect place for a camp. But once they started
building, strange things started to happen. One pitch black night, when
the wind was howling, a tree branch crashed through the roof of their
cabin! They screamed and ran outside, only to see the giant creature
rising from the earth! She had wild hair like the roots of a tree. Her
mouth had jagged rock teeth and her eyes were pools of black tar. But
her aura shimmered like diamonds. Anywhere she went, she left a trail of
 gem dust in her wake. Trembling, my great-grandparents asked who she
was and what she wanted. In a deep and hollow voice, she told them that
her name was Gaea Everfree – an ancient spirit who held domain over the
forest, and that my great-grandparents were trespassing on her land.
They begged her to let them stay and build their camp, to share this
wonderful place with others. Gaea Everfree finally agreed but warned
them that they would not be able to keep it forever. Someday, she will
return and reclaim the forest as her own.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: So if you see a trail of gem dust, you'll know that it is... [louder and scarier] Gaea Everfree!
</dd><dd><b>Students</b>: [screaming]
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: Hey, guys! Sorry, didn't mean to scare you!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Then why'd you come out of the bushes?
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: I... took the scenic route, because the
forest is beautiful at night. But no one else should do it without a
guide, kay? All right, everybody, time to head to your tents.
</dd><dd><b>Snips</b>: Oh, hey, Gloriosa. Do you have extra toothbrushes? I forgot mine.
</dd><dd>[fly buzzing]
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: Sure do! I'll get one for you.
</dd><dd><b>Snails</b>: [shuddering] I'm scared of the dark! Do you have flashlights?
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: Of course! I got this!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [struggling] Fluttershy?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Sorry, Spike. I guess that story got to me.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Why? It can't be real.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I don't know. Gaea Everfree could be some
creature that got booted from Equestria and ended up in this world.
That's what happened with the sirens.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Eh. Sounded more like something that Timber
was makin' up just to scare us. At least I hope it was. Last thing I
want is to have camp ruined by some power-crazed magical creature.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, hear-hear. We've had to deal with more than
our fair share of those. At the Fall Formal, a musical showcase, the
Friendship Ga— Well, I mean, you know, everything turned out all right,
of course [nervous chuckle]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Mmm. I'm kinda tired. I'm gonna turn in.

</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Twilight, we really have to talk about this.

</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Hey, I know you don't want to, but I

you could learn to control it—
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But that's just it! I'll never be able to control it!
</dd><dd>[crash]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What happened?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I didn't mean to!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: We didn't see anything, so we don't know what happened.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Are you okay?
</dd><dd><b>Sandalwood</b>: Yeah. It was so weird. We were stuck in a middle of the lake with no wind, then all of a sudden, <i>bam!</i> The wind picked up, and we were pushed right into the dock.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] You don't think it was the spirit, do you?!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [to herself] No, it was me.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Spirit, show yourself! The Great and Powerful Trixie commands it!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: What's that?!
</dd><dd><b>Students</b>: [concerned chatter]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh, man! All our hard work! Ruined!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: At least the fishies are eating well.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Let's salvage what we can out of the water. Maybe we can still fix this.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: We have to try! Camp Everfree needs a runway!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Dock.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Dock. Yes. That's what I meant.

</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Before you run off to chase squirrels, do you have any idea where Twilight could be? I really need to talk to her.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: What happened? Did she do that lifting things off the ground thing again?

</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: Uh... Looking for you.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, I just went on a nature walk and got a little lost.
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: Let me show you the way. I'm kind of an expert at these woods. I've lived here my whole life.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That must have been nice. Growing up at a camp.
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: Yeah, though it has its downsides. When I
 was younger, I wished we'd sell this place so we could live in a town
like normal people.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Really?
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: I was ten. I really wanted to hang out at the mall.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b> and <b>Timber Spruce</b>: [giggle]

</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: Not long. Just the whole time we were talking.

</dd><dd><b>Principal Celestia</b>: Is everything okay over there?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh, I don't know what happened. I didn't even pull the rope that hard. It's like she was light as a feather all of a sudden.

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I don't think it was your fault. I gonna go get Applejack a towel.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Me, too. [to Twilight] You're not the only one with a new kind of magic! This is great!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No, it's not! Rarity and Applejack could have really hurt each other! Why is this happening? I don't—
</dd><dd><b>Gloriosa Daisy</b>: Hi, girls! Anything I can do for you?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Uh, Applejack just fell into the lake!

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b> and <b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Fluttershy?

hoisted Rarity up the rock climbin' wall like it was nothin'! Like I had
 way more strength than I usually do.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: And I made a diamondy thing appear out of
nowhere, which normally I'd be excited about. I mean, the facets were

</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I don't know. I started running to get the harness, and the next thing I knew, I was practically back in town!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: But if you had some sort of super speed, why you were gone for so long?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Because I lost it when I got far away. And then it came back when I got close to camp.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] Being at camp is giving us all new magical abilities!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Not all of us have gotten new abilities. I haven't, but Twilight— ...hasn't, either.

</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I was oh, so excited about designs I've come up with for the camp fashion show.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: And I've barely gotten to whoop <i>anybody</i> in tetherball.

</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Hey, Twilight, why aren't you with everyone else?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Sunset said something at camp is
causing the other girls to get new magic. I think it's Midnight Sparkle.
 She's still part of me. I can feel it. And I think her magic is
infecting my friends.

<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Twilight, there's no Midnight Sparkle. There's only you.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: How did you know what I was thinking?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: When I touched your hand, I could see
things. I could understand why you were leaving. My new magic...! This
is my new magic! This is incredible!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No, it's not! I'm infecting you now!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Twilight, you have to stop looking at this as a bad thing.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Easy for you to say. Magic turned you
into something beautiful. The last time I tried to use it, it turned me
into a monster. I'm just so afraid it's gonna happen again.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Yes, last time I turned into something
amazing, but I've let magic turn me into a monster, too. So if anyone
understands what you're going through, it's me. I can help you,
Twilight. And the rest of our friends can be there for you, too. But not
 if you run away.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sighs] I'll stay. But I still don't
think it's a good idea for me to be near the rest of our friends right
now. Not until we know why this is happening.

</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: I was chopping down firewood.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: In the middle of the night?
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: We needed more for tomorrow night's
campfire. And if I didn't take care of it tonight, it would be one more
thing Gloriosa would add to her list. [imitating Gloriosa Daisy] I've
got this!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [chuckles]
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: What about you two? Why are you hanging out in the woods in the middle of the night?

</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Come on. That's obviously just a spooky story you made up to tell around the campfire.
</dd><dd><b>Timber Spruce</b>: Oh, no. It's legit. How else would you
explain what happened at the docks? And that weird thing where the earth
 shook? Come on. I know a shortcut back to the tents.
</dd><dd>[sparkling]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Legit, huh? I think we just found our "Gaea Everfree".
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: But why would he work so hard to make us think she was real?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: You heard what he said about wishing his
 sister would sell this camp. If nobody wants to come here because it's
home to some angry ancient nature spirit, it sure would help his cause.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: We should tell Twilight.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Not yet. She's obviously going through a
 lot right now. We should probably be a hundred percent sure before we
tell her the guy she likes is a jerk who's trying to run everybody out
of camp.

</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [sighs] Okay, here's the deal. My friend
 really likes someone, but I don't think that someone is who she thinks
they are. I don't wanna upset my friend by telling her what I think,
because I also want to protect her, because if what I think is happening
 is really happening, then she deserves to know. You know?
</dd><dd><b>Flash Sentry</b>: Nnnno. But what I <i>do</i> know is that your friend is lucky to have someone like you to look out for them.
