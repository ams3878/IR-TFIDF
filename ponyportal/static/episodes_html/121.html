</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Hear ye, hear ye! The first <i>post</i>-cutie mark meetin' of the Cutie Mark Crusaders is now in session!
</dd><dd>[long pause]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: [clears throat]
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Oh! I'm sorry, Apple Bloom. I was distracted by the radiance of my cutie mark... Did you say something?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I mean... it's pretty amazing how the colors just pop off your flank. It's kinda hard to look aw—
</dd><dd>[thump]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Look, I know our cutie marks are amazing,
but is that all we're gonna do now? Just spend our days starin' down at
our own flanks?
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [sighs] I guess not.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Yeah, I suppose that could get real boring...
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: [wistfully] Yeah... [beat] This is ridiculous! We need to go out and do somethin'!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Wow, you're right!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Yeah, we need to go try new stuff like we used to!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Exactly.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Like square dancing!
</dd><dd>[square dancing music]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Or mountain climbing! [stock yodel]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Or square dancin' on the mountain we just climbed! [same yodel over square dancing music]
</dd><dd><b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: Yeah!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: And the more things we try, the more chances we'll have to finally get our cutie marks! Come on!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Um... Apple Bloom?

<dl><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Wow... Did we really only ever do things <i>just</i> to get our cutie marks?
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I don't know. Maybe?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Aw, come on! We did lots of stuff that didn't have anything to do with getting a cutie mark.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Of course we did!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Absolutely!
</dd><dd>[montage music]
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Huh. So now that we don't have to do stuff to get our cutie marks, what is it that the Cutie Mark Crusaders actually do?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: We do exactly what we got our cutie marks in!
</dd><dd><b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: Helping other ponies!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Ponies without cutie marks!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Or ponies who've forgotten their special purpose!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Exactly! We just have to find ponies who need our help! Come on!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: But are you sure you feel content?
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Not even a <i>tinge</i> of dissatisfaction?
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: Nnnope.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Not even the <i>slightest</i> naggin' sensation that you don't really know what your purpose is in life or why you have a big apple as a cutie mark?
</dd><dd>[thump]
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: [grunts] [spits] [annoyed] Nnnope.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: The important thing to remember is that there is no rush.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: The three of us tried for the <i>longest</i> time, but it just comes when it comes!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: And it's totally normal to feel confused and maybe even a little lost. But being a blank flank is nothing to be ashamed of.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: So if you're having even the slightest problem...
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: ...or concerns or questions...
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: ...we want you to know that we are here to help.
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: I... don't think they're too worried about it yet.

<dl><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: This is gonna be a lot harder than I thought.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Who knew there were so few ponies worried about their cutie marks?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Kinda makes you wonder why <i>we</i> made such a big deal out of it for so long.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: What?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: The point is, helpin' ponies with cutie mark problems is what makes us special.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: But if we can't find anypony with a problem...
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: ...Maybe <i>we're</i> not special.
</dd><dd><b>Bulk Biceps</b>: <i>Yeah!</i> I know exactly what you mean. You can't find a cutie mark problem. <i>I</i> have a cutie mark problem. It's so confusing, and I feel like the solution is staring me right in the muzzle.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Bulk Biceps</b>: What?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Bulk Biceps</b>: I see why you guys hang out here! It's cozy!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [straining] The Crusader Clubhouse is a safe place, Mr... um... Bulk.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: A place where we faced all kinds of cutie mark problems!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: A place where we'll go on to solve even more! Startin' with yours!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: No matter how long it takes!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Or how hard it is!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: We'll solve it because that's what we do!
</dd><dd><b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: Yeah! [straining]
</dd><dd><b>Bulk Biceps</b>: <i>Yeah!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: So... what's your cutie mark problem?
</dd><dd><b>Bulk Biceps</b>: Oh, right. Uh, well, my cutie mark is a dumbbell, but I've lifted every dumbbell in Ponyville!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [nervously] Have you tried lifting other things?
</dd><dd><b>Bulk Biceps</b>: You mean, not dumbbells?
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Yeah!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Yeah!
</dd><dd><b>Bulk Biceps</b>: <i>Yeah!</i>
</dd><dd>[crunch]
</dd><dd><b>Bulk Biceps</b>: Oof! I mean... no. I hadn't thought of that. <i>You guys are awesome!</i>
</dd><dd>[crunch]
</dd><dd><b>Bulk Biceps</b>: But... what happens when I run out of other stuff?
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: ...I guess you could teach other ponies to lift things?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Yeah!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Yeah!
</dd><dd><b>Bulk Biceps</b>: <i>Yeah!</i> Wow, you three really have a knack for this!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: That <i>was</i> easy!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Maybe <i>too</i> easy.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: What do you mean?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Well, it's lookin' like cutie mark problems are few and far between.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: And...?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: And what if we never find another one?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Well...
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: And even if we do, we could solve it so quick, it'll be like it never happened in the first place!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: So...?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: So... then the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't have any reason to exist!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: The problem boils down to this – we don't need to go out and do things anymore to get our cutie marks.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Right! And—
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Ponies with cutie mark problems are hard to find.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Exactly. But even when we find problems,
we're so good at solvin' them that most of the time there's nothin' for
the Cutie Mark Crusaders to do. So...
</dd><dd>[map unfurling]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: I thought we should start figurin' out ways to search all of Equestria for cutie mark problems!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: That kinda seems like a lot.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I don't think Rarity would let me travel to the far reaches of Equestria looking for cutie mark problems.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Yeah, I'm sure we'll come across them in Ponyville. And when we do, we'll totally solve them because we are so awesome at it!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b> and <b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Hoof!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: But... what do we do <i>until</i> then?
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Maybe whatever we want?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: What do you mean?
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Well, we used to only do stuff to get our cutie marks or fulfill our destiny, but now we don't have to.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: So... we can do things just for fun? Are you girls thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b> and <b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Sure am!

</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Well, I know this might sound crazy, but what if we didn't?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Didn't what?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Do things together. Well, do <i>everything</i> together.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: But we're the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: And we always will be! But I <i>really</i> wanna bungee jump! The speed, the height, the fall!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: And I know you two aren't interested, but I wanna try crochet.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Isn't there something <i>you've</i> always wanted to do on your own?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: I don't know... I guess I figured we'd
always do stuff together. But bungee jumping sounds just as scary as
crochet sounds borin'.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: That's okay. Sweetie Belle and I can do the things we like, and you can do whatever you like!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Just as soon as you figure out what it is.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: I guess...
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Great! Then we can meet back here and talk all about what we've done!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: But I don't know what it'll be.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: You'll find something!

</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Whatever kind of dancin' y'all are doin',
you're doin' it together, and I want in! [beat] I-I mean, uh, [clears
throat] Would it be okay if I enrolled in this dance class?
</dd><dd><b>Hoofer Steps</b>: Well, let's see what you can do. We have a
 recital at town hall tonight, and a spot just opened up! [hushed]
Tender Taps is a little too shy to perform. But if you're ready to step
into a partnered routine...
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: That sounds an awful lot like friendship! And I'm ready for anything I don't have to do by myself!
</dd><dd><b>Hoofer Steps</b>: Well then! Dancing with partner will be perfect. [claps]

</dd><dd>[thump]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Whew! I feel like that went pretty good,
but let's give it one more whirl, because it's important that I do a
good job partnering with my new group of friends.
</dd><dd><b>Hoofer Steps</b>: Eh... Now I'm think of it, you might be better as soloist.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hoofer Steps</b>: Uh, partnering is a little advanced for you. But there's still lots you can do on your own.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: I'm sorry, but doin' stuff on my own is exactly what I <i>don't</i> want.
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Tender Taps</b>: Sorry it didn't work out.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Tryin' different things with my friends is always fun, even when we were terrible. Now it's <i>just</i> terrible.
</dd><dd><b>Tender Taps</b>: You weren't that bad. You just need to
learn a few things on your own. Being a soloist can be fun! [tap
dancing] Ha. Haha! You just have to do it with feeling!
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: [sighs] Thanks, but... without my friends, I don't think I'll ever feel again. Good luck at the recital.
</dd><dd><b>Tender Taps</b>: Oh, I'm not gonna do that. I mean, I want
to. It's kind of all I think about. I bet some day my cutie mark will
even be about performing! But I could never dance in front of an
audience the way I do in class. That's t-t-t-t-terrifying!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: [deadpan] Yeah, okay. Nice meetin' you.
</dd><dd><b>Tender Taps</b>: You, too. [tap dancing]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Sweetie Belle! You are not gonna believe this, but I think I like bungee jumping even <i>more</i> than scootering!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: <i>Seriously?!</i> That's amazing! Look what I did!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Wow, uh, that's, um...
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Horrible! But it was so much fun! Rarity
showed me how, even though she says [imitating Rarity] "Crochet is
knitting's poorer cousin", [normal] but I <i>loved</i> it!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Awesome!
</dd><dd>[door creaks open]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Oh, hello, girls. Have fun pursuing your <i>own</i> interests?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Apple Bloom? What are you doing sitting in the dark?
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Yeah, we thought you'd be out looking for things you like to do.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: [laughs] I did. I looked all over town. I looked... and I looked... and I looked... and you know what I found? <i>Nothin'!</i>
</dd><dd>[blind snaps up]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: You tried every one of these?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: And each one just made me feel more alone
than the next! I don't see how I'm supposed to be happy that we're not
hanging out anymore!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Wait, I never said that. I just said we don't have to do <i>everything</i> together.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Like when there's something one of us wants to do that the others don't.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Oh. [beat] Well, I guess that changes things.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I can't believe you thought we didn't want to hang out anymore.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I can't believe you tried all this stuff and didn't find one thing you liked!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Well, I kind of liked dancin', mainly because it looked like somethin' you couldn't do alone, but... I wasn't very good at it.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Well, you don't have to be good at something to have fun!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: And being good doesn't always mean you will.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: I know... I met the best dancer in the
world, but he was so shy, he couldn't bring himself to perform, even
though he really, really wanted to.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I don't suppose this dancing pony had a cutie mark, did he?

</dd><dd><b>Tender Taps</b>: What are you doing here?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: You told me that you wanted to perform more
 than anythin', but I was too caught up in myself to listen. You're the
best dancer I've ever seen, and I'm here to convince you to get out on
that stage!
</dd><dd>[piano playing]
</dd><dd><b>Tender Taps</b>: Um, didn't I also tell you that dancing in
front of other ponies is t-t-terrifying?! I don't know if you noticed,
but that auditorium is full of other ponies! I can't go out there! What
if I'm bad?!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: We can go on together! No matter what, you'll look good dancin' next to me.
</dd><dd>[audience cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Tender Taps</b>: [sighs] All right, I'll do it. But I don't
have my costume, and the backdrop is all wrong, and we don't have time
to change it!

</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: No problem!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: It's what we do.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: I only wish I'd realized what you needed right away instead of mopin' around for no reason...
</dd><dd><b>Tender Taps</b>: Well, either way, I hope you keep dancing. [short tap-dancing burst]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: [taps] You know, I just might! It sure is a
 lot of fun, and I'm pretty confident I can only get better. [to the
Crusaders] I'm sorry I was so silly about us all doin' our own things.
If we hadn't, I might never even have tried dancin'!
</dd><dd><b>Tender Taps</b>: Or find out I needed help!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: With each of us going out and trying things on our own, we'll be three times as likely to find ponies to help!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: And trying new stuff might even make us better at helping them, like how I used my bungee jumping to change the sets!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Or my crochet to make the costumes!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Well, one thing is for sure. The Cutie Mark Crusaders will never be the same. We'll be better!
