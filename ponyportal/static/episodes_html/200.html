</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Whoa!
</dd><dd>[thud!]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Twilight, mail's here!
</dd><dd>[doors opening]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd>[squeak]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Are you all right?
</dd><dd><b>Derpy</b>: We just had a really heavy delivery today.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Is it a deluxe set of special edition <i>Ogres &amp; Oubliettes</i> figurines that I'm totally surprised by and have been hinting that I need forever?
</dd><dd><b>Derpy</b>: Well, it's for Twilight.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Awww...
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Thank you.
</dd><dd><b>Derpy</b>: You're welcome!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Huh. It's from Princess Celestia.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [belches] So is this. Really? She couldn't have put it into the box?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [reading] "My dearest Twilight, I have
 been conducting a thorough cleaning of the castle, and I came across a
few items of yours in your old room. I thought you might want them
back." I didn't even know I'd left anything! Awww, look! Remember this?
It's the macaroni picture frame Cadance helped me make when I was a
filly!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [quietly, sarcastic] Who could forget a masterpiece like that?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: My G1 Star Swirl figure! And some of my favorite school scrolls! <i>And</i> here's my extra extra credit report on "The Impediments of Using Magic in Everyday Chores"! Ha! Still so true!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Is my <i>Smash Fortune</i> comic in there? I've been looking for that for years. Whoa, whoa!
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [muffled] Or this.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, no! Oh, no! <i>Oh, no!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: What's wrong? It just looks like an old library book.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Exactly! It belongs to the Canterlot Library! That means it's... overdue!

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You don't understand, Spike! I have a perfect library book return record!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [clears throat] <i>Had</i> a perfect record.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [groans] I've never turned in a book even a <i>minute</i> late! And <i>this</i> one has been overdue since I left for Ponyville!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[stamping]
</dd><dd><b>Dusty Pages</b>: Make sure you bring this one back on time. We've got a long waiting list of ponies who can't wait to read it.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I promise I won't let you down!
</dd><dd><b>Dusty Pages</b>: Oh, of course, you won't, dear. If there's
anypony I can trust to take care of a book, it's you, Twilight Sparkle.
After all, you still hold the "Best Book Borrower" title.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oooh! I hope I do forever!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spi-ike! Quick, find me that old copy of <i>Predictions and Prophecies</i>. What's that for?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Well, it <i>was</i> a gift for Moon Dancer, but...
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, Spike, you know we don't have time for that sort of thing.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And then Celestia sent me to Ponyville,
 and I forgot all about this! Dusty Pages prided herself that no books
were damaged or lost on her watch, and I failed her! I failed myself!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I take it we're going to Canterlot?
</dd><dd>[zip!]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [groans] The sooner, the better, I guess.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd>[leaves rustling]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Uh, why are we hiding? Don't you wanna return your book?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yes. But what if somepony sees me in
there? I'm the Princess of Friendship. Everywhere I go, ponies recognize
 me. I'll stick out like a sore hoof.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [incredulously] Princess Twilight Sparkle in a library? Stop the presses!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: A late book is a big deal, Spike. What
 if Dusty Pages revokes my library card? Or bans me from ever entering
the building again?!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Don't you already have most of those books in your collection at home?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yes, but the ones in there have a special Canterlot Library-y smell!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: You sniff books?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You <i>don't?</i> I used to <i>live</i> in a library. If I'm not a good example of proper book borrowing behavior, then what kind of princess <i>am</i> I?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: One that makes mistakes like everypony else. Trust me. Once you return that book, you'll feel way better.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Thanks, Spike. Let's go! [screams, giggles nervously]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [groans]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[teleportation zaps]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps, clears throat, deep voice] I have a book to return.
</dd><dd><b>Librarian Pony</b>: Princess Twilight! So good to see you!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [groans]
</dd><dd><b>Librarian Pony</b>: Need some recommendations from the new release section?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps] Is that the new edition of Mooncurve's <i>Seven Theories on Bending Time</i>? I have been waiting for the release sin— Uh, I mean, uh, no books today! [chuckles] Thanks!
</dd><dd>[ponies gasp]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But I do need to speak with Dusty Pages about a... [clears throat] sensitive matter.
</dd><dd><b>Librarian Pony</b>: Dusty who?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [nervous laugh] Dusty Pages? The head librarian? She's worked here forever.
</dd><dd><b>Librarian Pony</b>: I'm sorry, princess. I don't know her. Now, was there some other way I can help the library's Best Book Borrower?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [nervous giggle]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [hushed] Just ask where to return an overdue book! It's no big deal! It happens all the time!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [hushed] Not to me it doesn't! [sighs]
 Fine. Fine! Oh, no! I didn't even think about the late fine! A book out
 this long will probably cost a thousand bits!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: She— I mean, <i>we</i> have an overdue book.
</dd><dd><b>Librarian Pony</b>: [laughs] Well, that's no problem at all. In fact, it happens all the time.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: See?
</dd><dd><b>Librarian Pony</b>: I'll just find it in the card catalog.
Uh, number one-eight-nine-oh-five, got it! [laughs] Oh, wow. Yeesh. I
haven't seen a book this late in... well, ever. [clears throat] You need
 to go and see First Folio in the Grossly Overdue Book Return Office for
 Ponies Who Should Know Better.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Don't pull any punches with those names, do you?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: And that office would be...?
</dd><dd><b>Librarian Pony</b>: In the basement. [whispering] Because of the <i>shame</i>.
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: Whoa. [strains] Looks like nopony ever goes down here.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Nopony except undependable rule-breakers who deserve all the horrors this hallway holds!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: <i>And</i> faithful dragon companions. Uh... hey! It looks like First Folio left a note on the door!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: "Abandon hope, all ye who enter"?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [reading] "Out to lunch on Restaurant Row." Guess we'll have to try back later!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No! I can't wait another minute to
return this book! In the time it took us to get there, I racked up
another... seventeen bits in late fees! We're going to lunch!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Good, 'cause I'm starving! [licks lips]
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh. You mean to find First Folio. Can we at least get takeout?!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Tell me if you see any librarian-type ponies.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Twilight, we tried this at three other restaurants already!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And my late fines are already up another twenty-six more bits!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [mock-sobbing]
</dd><dd><b>Pretzel</b>: Waiter, we're ready to order.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh, uh, I'm not actually—
</dd><dd><b>Pretzel</b>: Three samosas, two curry specials... Do you think that's enough for the two of us?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Hm. Well, I would probably order some naan as well. For the table?
</dd><dd><b>Pretzel</b>: Sounds great.
</dd><dd><b>Moon Dancer</b>: Twilight? Is that you?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Moon Dancer! How've you been? I'm just visiting. No real reason. Heh.
</dd><dd><b>Moon Dancer</b>: Well, it's good to see you! I'm just meeting my friend, First Folio, for lunch. Do you want to join us?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: First Folio?! Yes! I mean, thank you.
</dd><dd><b>First Folio</b>: Princess Twilight, good to meet you! Did you know your picture is still up in our library as the Best Book Borrower?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah... I was hoping I could talk to Dusty Pages about that.
</dd><dd><b>Moon Dancer</b>: Oh, Dusty Pages left the library moons ago. Didn't you know?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Mm-mm.
</dd><dd><b>First Folio</b>: Oh, I heard she was forced to leave. It's so sad. She loved the library.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Wait. Forced to leave?
</dd><dd><b>First Folio</b>: Yuh-huh, uh-huh, yeah. She had a perfect librarian record. Until one careless pony didn't return a book, ruined it all.
</dd><dd><b>Moon Dancer</b>: Are you okay, Twilight?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [nervously] Uh-huh. Would, uh, you excuse me?
</dd><dd>[whoosh]
</dd><dd>[spinning]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: That's why you only order spicy if you can take it. Twilight, what's wrong?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Dusty Pages isn't working at the library any more because <i>I</i> didn't return this book! Spike, I think <i>I</i> got her fired!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[brake skids]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Twilight, the library is <i>that</i> way!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Change of plans. We're going to Dusty's house. She used to invite me over for tea all the time.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: But what about your late fees?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: They're not as important as making things right.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Wait. So you're <i>not</i> going to return the book?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No. Dusty Pages is. It's my fault she
lost her job. So if I give her the book, she can get her old job back.
It'll fix everything! [sighs]
</dd><dd>[knocking]
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Meathead Pony</b>: Didn't you see the sign? No salesponies!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, I'm not selling anything.
</dd><dd><b>Meathead Pony</b>: No carolers either. No surveys, no petitions, no free literature...
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No problem. I'm just looking for somepony who used to live here. I'm pretty sure this was her house.
</dd><dd><b>Meathead Pony</b>: Dusty Pages?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yes!
</dd><dd><b>Meathead Pony</b>: Hold on. She moved to... Silver somethin'. Shoals, Seas, Surfer, whatever. When you find her, give her this.
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Meathead Pony</b>: It's been stackin' up for years! And tell her to <i>change her address!</i>

<dl><dd>[squeaking]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [reading] "Silver Stable Community: For the best golden years." This has to be it!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I hope so. It's the last "Silver" spot on the map we haven't looked.
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [straining] [gasps] Whoa! This place is—
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Terrible, I know! There's not a single bookshelf in sight!
</dd><dd><b>Sand Trap</b>: [snoring]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Poor Dusty... [to receptionist] Excuse me!
</dd><dd><b>"Teddie Safari"</b>: Yes, how may I help you?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Do you have a resident named Dusty Pages?
</dd><dd><b>"Teddie Safari"</b>: Oh, yes. Her apartment is in the next complex, ground floor.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Thank you!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I can't believe that <i>my</i> carelessness sent her <i>here</i>, when she could be happily surrounded by millions of wonderful-smelling books!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: You realize that might just be a you thing, right?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps] There she is! Here we go. [exhales]
</dd><dd>[knocking]
</dd><dd>[long pause]
</dd><dd>[watch ticking]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [groans]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: She's bound to be back soon. Maybe we should just wait here.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No. We are fixing this <i>now</i>. This place isn't that big. We can find her.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Sorry to interrupt your <i>plein air</i> painting, but we're looking for Dusty Pages. Have you seen her?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Rose</b>: Sure have!
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sighs] And...?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Rose</b>: She had to leave early to get to her <i>fengbi de ti</i> session.
</dd><dd><b>Old Stallion</b>: Which is right before she leads the woodworking class with me. Then she's on to windsurfing.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Rose</b>: Ooh, and don't forget theatre rehearsal! Dusty's playing the lead role. Again.
</dd><dd><b>Old Stallion</b>: Then there's her band practice later.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Thank you!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Wow. Dusty sounds like one busy pony.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, she's just filling her days with distractions to cover the pain of losing the best job ever! But not for long!

</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Wait. She looks pretty happy up there.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Trust me, it's all an act. She'll be a lot happier when I deliver the news that she can go back to working at the library!
</dd><dd>[music abruptly stops]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Care to take five, everypony?
</dd><dd><b>Dusty Pages</b>: Ah! Twilight Sparkle?! My stars! It's so wonderful to see you! What are you doing here?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I've been looking all over Equestria for you!
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I need to tell you something.
</dd><dd><b>Dusty Pages</b>: Well, you brought my mail! Oh, thank you! [chuckles]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No. I mean, yes, we did, but that's not why we're here. I let you down, and I can't forgive myself until I set things right.
</dd><dd><b>Dusty Pages</b>: I don't remember you doing anything wrong.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You told me to take care of a special book I checked out from the Canterlot Library, and I never brought it back!
</dd><dd><b>Dusty Pages</b>: [gasps] It was <i>you</i> that had that book out? The one that broke my perfect record?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But now you can bring it to Canterlot Library and get your job back!
</dd><dd><b>Dusty Pages</b>: No, thank you! I don't ever need to see that library again! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have somewhere to be.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[band playing music]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [snapping fingers]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Do you mind?
</dd><dd>[music pauses, continues softly]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [slurping]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I don't understand. If Dusty Pages
won't go back to Canterlot Library and explain everything, then she
won't be able to get her job back. Even worse, her record will remain
imperfect!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: And yours will, too?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, yeah! But that doesn't matter any more!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [dryly] Really?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, maybe a little bit. Oh, no, bits! The late fines! How much do I owe now?!
</dd><dd>[abacus clicking]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Uhhh... you don't wanna know.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [groans] It would've been worth all
the bits in Equestria if I had made things right with Dusty! I wish I
knew why she won't go back!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Why don't you ask her?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: She didn't seem to want to talk.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: You surprised her, and she probably had something
 else on her schedule. That thing is packed! Come on. What have you got
to lose?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Now that I've messed up this much?
Nothing. You're right, Spike. It's worth a try. Where do you think she
went? Crochet? Bingo?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[splat]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: A squishy fruit food-fight tournament?!
</dd><dd>[splats]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Hey, everypony! We come in—
</dd><dd>[splat]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Eh, pieces.
</dd><dd>[splats]
</dd><dd>[teleportation zap]
</dd><dd>[splats]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Stop! We just want to talk to Dusty Pages for a moment! Please?
</dd><dd><b>Dusty Pages</b>: <i>Time out!</i> [to Twilight] Next time, you should rent gear.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: We're not actually here for the game.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I was hoping you'd give me another chance to talk to you about the library book.
</dd><dd><b>Dusty Pages</b>: [sighs] This really means a lot to you, doesn't it?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Mm-hmm. I know I ruined your life by
not returning my book on time, and I will do anything I can to make it
up to you. Even promise to never take a book out of a library again, if
that's what it takes.
</dd><dd>[ponies gasp]
</dd><dd><b>Dusty Pages</b>: [laughs]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: That is not the reaction we expected.
</dd><dd><b>Dusty Pages</b>: Twilight, dear, you've got it all backwards! I'm not upset with you!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You're not?
</dd><dd><b>Dusty Pages</b>: No! If I'm mad at anypony, it's me.
</dd><dd>[tapping]
</dd><dd><b>Dusty Pages</b>: All those years I spent hiding away in that
 library, trying to be perfect. When your book never came in, I felt
something exhilarating!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What was it?
</dd><dd><b>Dusty Pages</b>: Freedom.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: From books?
</dd><dd><b>Dusty Pages</b>: From perfection! I was too stubborn to know
 when to call it quits! It took your mistake to make me realize that I
wasn't living the life I wanted!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You mean you weren't fired? You left the library because you <i>wanted</i> to?
</dd><dd><b>Dusty Pages</b>: Twilight, your late book was the best thing
 that ever happened to me. Now I'm not afraid to try things I might fail
 at. In fact, sometimes messing up teaches me more than getting it
right!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You're sure you don't want to return it and get that perfect record back?
</dd><dd>[splat]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [strangled scream]
</dd><dd><b>Dusty Pages</b>: Ah, good. It was a yellow one. You can still see the words.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But it'll have a stain!
</dd><dd><b>Dusty Pages</b>: That doesn't change the truth inside it. Wait. Did you even read that thing?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Actually, uh, no, I guess I didn't.
</dd><dd>[splat]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [reading] "Perfection".
</dd><dd><b>Dusty Pages</b>: And the next part?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [reading] "The Impossible Pursuit".
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b> and <b>Dusty Pages</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh. That might've been useful to look at earlier.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>First Folio</b>: Uh-huh... Your total late fees come to...
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: However much it is, I'll cover it. Uh, do you have a monthly payment plan?
</dd><dd><b>First Folio</b>: Twenty-eight bits.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b> and <b>Spike</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: That's <i>it</i>?!
</dd><dd><b>First Folio</b>: Yah-huh. Most ponies don't know that it caps at a month. Probably 'cause we don't tell them. [snorts]
</dd><dd>[bits clinking]
</dd><dd><b>First Folio</b>: Thank you. Your account is back to normal. Although we will be taking down your Best Book Borrower picture.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Um, is that <i>really</i> necessary? Heh. It just seems so permanent. Heh. I mean, I did return the book, after all.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [clears throat]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Okay. Letting the perfection go. [sighs] You want me to reshelve this for you?
</dd><dd><b>First Folio</b>: No, it's an old edition. We've already replaced it with a new copy.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: In that case, can we keep it? It might be a good reminder to have around.
</dd><dd><b>First Folio</b>: You sure? It's got a stain.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That's what makes it perfect.
