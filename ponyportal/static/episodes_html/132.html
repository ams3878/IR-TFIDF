</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I'm so sorry I lost track of time at our
picnic. I didn't mean for us to get caught out here after dark. But
there's really nothing to be afraid of. The forest at night is the same
as the forest during the day.
</dd><dd>[wind gusts, howls]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Only... darker.
</dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: [teeth chattering]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Still, maybe we should hurry back to the cottage.
</dd><dd>[whoosh]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Nothing to worry about. No reason to...
</dd><dd>[whoosh]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [eerie wailing]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: <i>Ruuuun!</i>
</dd><dd>[zip]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Aah! [gasping]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [eerie wailing]
</dd><dd>[thunderclap]
</dd><dd>[roars]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [screams]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [laughs] Gotcha! [laughs harder]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [hyperventilating] That wasn't funny! You really scared me! I hope you're happy.
</dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: [growls]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Nope. You're too easy. You're scared of <i>every</i>thing.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: That's not true.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Boo.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Aah! [chattering]
</dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: [grunts]

<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I mean, how could you not appreciate <i>that</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Because I don't think being scared is very fun!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I do! Your heart gets all racy, your hooves
get all tingly, your mouth gets all dry-ie! Actually, I don't like that
part. But the rest is great!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: See? <i>Every</i>pony likes a good prank! They're just jokes!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Now, Rainbow Dash, I don't think Fluttershy
would have called us all here to talk about this if she thought it was
funny. Everypony has things they like and things they don't.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: And scarin' Fluttershy is just lazy.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [scoffs] Lazy?!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: A prank isn't very good if you're the only pony laughing.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: But what if it's really, really, really, really, <i>really</i> funny?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: And I can do funny.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I know you can. I guess the trick is making sure that your idea of funny matches the pony you're pranking.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [stifling giggle]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That way—
</dd><dd>[prolonged fart noise]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [laughs]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [stifling laugh]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b> and <b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Good one, Rainbow! Ha-ha! You have to admit! That was funny!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Not really.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Yeah. A whoopee cushion is like a joke shortcut.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b> and <b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>What?!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Honestly, Rainbow Dash, if you are not willing
to put forth the effort required to pull a prank that everypony can
enjoy, you may as well not pull one at all.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Fine! If you ponies want effort, then that's just what you'll get.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm not sure she understood what we meant.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I know you're excited about the Filly Guide Cookie Drive, but I still have to do a few finishing touches on your uniform.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [lips smacking] Hmm. Not bad.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Huh. [reading] "You asked for it."
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: What does it mean?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Hmm. I assume this is Dash's idea of a prank,
which can only mean she's rigged some kind of booby trap to your Filly
Guide uniform up there.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: So how do we get it down?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: We don't. If Dash thinks I'm going to fall for
whatever she's got in mind, she's got another thing coming. There's more
 uniforms where that one came from!
</dd><dd>[splat]
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Hmm. The sewing machine cake is actually better than the <i>cake</i> cake.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Rainbow Dash!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [laughs] Gotcha! Ha-ha! How's <i>that</i> for effort?

</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: What's all this, Applejack? I thought you were gonna help me get ready for the Filly Guide Cookie Drive.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh, yeah, sorry about that. But Rainbow Dash has been on a prankin' tear, and you can never be too careful.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Do you really think Dash is gonna try and prank you in your sleep?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Not if I have anythin' to say about it.

<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie! We need your help.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Okay! For what?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Are you honestly going to stand there and tell us you know nothing about all the pranking Rainbow Dash has been doing?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh, no! She's been pranking up a storm!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Did she get you, too?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [laughs] Oh, yeah! She and Gummy both!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Boo!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Aaah! [giggling]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: They got me <i>good</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, she needs to stop.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Stop? But pranks are so much fun!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Not for everypony. And it doesn't seem like Dash is taking the time to find out who enjoys them and who doesn't.
</dd><dd><b>All but Twilight</b>: [grumble]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Uh, since you and Dash share such an, uh,
affinity for pranking, we thought you might be able to get her to, um,
uh... quit it!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hey, Rainbow Dash! I have something very important to tell you!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Pinkie, hey! I actually have something totally important to tell <i>you</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You do? Ooh! You go first!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Okay, you know how I've been pranking everypony?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yeah! [giggles] It's been pretty funny! I-I-I mean, actually, that's what I have to talk to <i>you</i> about.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Here. Have a cookie.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ooh! Thanks! [chomps]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: So, I got to thinking – why waste my time pranking everypony one at a time when I could prank everypony at once?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Mmm, wow! Everypony at once?! That sounds amazing!
</dd><dd>[record needle scratches]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Gah, wait! I mean, it's not.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You don't even know what it is yet!
Pinkie, this is gonna be the best prank ever! I special ordered these
joke cookies so the colors would match my mane.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: And?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: And I'm gonna switch them with the Filly
Guide cookies. When Scootaloo and her friends sell them, everypony in
town's gonna get a rainbow mouth courtesy of Rainbow Dash! Ha-ha! It's
gonna be so awesome!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Uh, I don't know. I mean, it doesn't really seem all that funny.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [gasps] What?!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Maybe this is a good time to stop pranking for a while. The other ponies in town really—
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Stop?! No way! This prank is happening, Pinkie! And it's gonna be <i>hilarious!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [chomps]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Pinkie, what's the deal? I told you I
needed your help switching out all the Filly Guide cookies for the joke
cookies. But when you didn't show, I had to do it all by myself! Uh,
Pinkie?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [coughs]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [chuckles] Wow. Your face is still pretty rainbowed.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yeah, I haven't really [coughs] been feeling well. And these joke cookies are the only thing that makes me feel better. <i>You don't have any more, do you?!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, no. I just told you, I used them all for the prank.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Pretty soon, the CMCs will start selling
them to everypony in town. Ponies will open their boxes and start
eating, then all of their teeth will turn rainbow-colored, and they'll
know it was me! It's gonna be so awesome! C'mon, you don't wanna miss
it!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Actually... [coughs] I don't think I can even... stand... up... [raspy] <i>Unless you've got more cookies!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Aah! On second thought, maybe you better stay here and rest.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [sighs] Yeah. You're right. Sorry to miss out. I'm sure it's gonna be hilarious.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: All right, who's ready to sell some cookies?
</dd><dd><b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: Me!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Look here, Rainbow Dash. I know you promised
Scootaloo you'd help out, but I don't want none of your pranks ruinin'
these fillies' night.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Look, I'll be with you the whole night so you can totally keep an eye on me.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Come on, Applejack! Let's get started!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Yeah! We've got a lot of ground to cover!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: We wanna hit every house in Ponyville!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Come on! You heard her! Every house in Ponyville! [laughs]
</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I think you three should be real proud. Y'all did a mighty impressive job for your first go-'round.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: You took the words right out of my mouth, Applejack. Isn't that right, Rainbow Dash?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [hushed] Any minute now.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh... "any minute now" what?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Huh? Oh, uh, nothing! Have you guys noticed how quiet it's gotten? I mean, it's still early, right?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Of course it's quiet. Ponies can't talk while they're eating those fabulous cookies, heh.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You think?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Of course. They're probably all in a cookie coma right now.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Huh... Maybe you're right. I'll go check.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What is going on...? Okay. Definite cookie-eating happening. But... where <i>is</i>
 everypony? They must have seen their rainbow mouths by now... They
should all be running out into the streets! Unless everypony went to bed
 early...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Pinkie?
</dd><dd>[crunch]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: The whole town got the cookies, and now
everypony is shut up in their houses! You don't think there's something
wrong with the joke cookies, do you?
</dd><dd>[clatter]
</dd><dd>[clatter]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Mrs. Cake! Phew! Have you seen Pinkie? I was thinking <i>I</i> might have something to do with her not feeling great.
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: [chewing, husky breathing]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh... Mrs... Cake...?
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: [droning] <i>Cookies...! Cookies!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [whimper] Uh, I can see you're busy! I'll come back!
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uhh!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [droning] Cookies...!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [screams]

</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [panting]
</dd><dd>[munching]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [pant] Twilight! [pant] You gotta come
with me to Sugarcube Corner! Something's going on with the Cakes! Well,
not something exactly. I mean, it may have something to do with these
joke cookies...

</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: [droning] Cookies...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: You sure you don't mind us all comin' over?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, of course not. I think the girls have earned
 a little celebration for all of their hard work. And I have plenty of
sewing machine cake left over. Unless anypony wants a cookie...?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: <i>Don't touch those!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh! There is certainly no call for that! There's plenty for everypony.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Come on! We gotta get outta here!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: What in tarnation are you goin' on about?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: There's no time! You have to follow me!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, Rainbow Dash, if you want all of those cookies, you will have to buy them, just like everypony else.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I don't want the cookies—!
</dd><dd>[ponies groaning]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: But <i>they</i> do!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Wh-wh-what... What's happening?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'll explain later. Come on!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [panting]
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: We need to find somewhere to hide!
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Cookie! Cookie!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: This way!
</dd><dd>[ponies groaning]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[bucking]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [spits, pants] Did we lose them?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [pants] Why are we running from the ponies of Ponyville?
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: What happened to all of our friends?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sighs] I think it's something in the cookies.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Ugh! That's ridiculous! Filly Guide cookies
haven't changed for years! It's not like there's a new ingredient that's
 turnin' the whole town into cookie-cravin' zombies.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, unless there... is...
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: What are you saying?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: What did you do?
</dd><dd>[crunch]
</dd><dd><b>Zombie ponies</b>: [droning] Coooooookiiiiiiiieeeee... coooooookiiiiiiieeee....
</dd><dd>[door rattling]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Cover the windows!
</dd><dd><b>Zombie ponies</b>: Coooook...
</dd><dd>[pounding on door]
</dd><dd><b>Zombie ponies</b>: [droning] Cooooooookieeeee..... cooookiiiiieeeeeeee... [etc.]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [pants] Okay! So I may have switched all
the Filly Guide cookies for joke cookies that were supposed to make
ponies' mouths rainbow but somehow turned everypony into mindless
cookie-eating zombies instead! I figure we just hide out here until the
effects wear off, and as long as nopony else eats the cookies, we'll be
fine.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: That's lovely, darling, except for one thing... [droning] We've already eaten theeeeeeeeeemmmmm...
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [droning] Looks like your prank up and backfiiiirrrrreeeeed...
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [screams]
</dd><dd><b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: [droning] Cooooooookiiiieeeees...
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd>[crunch]
</dd><dd>[zombie ponies groaning]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: No, no! Stay away! They're making you sick! You don't want these!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [droning] But we dooooooo... We want cookiiiiiiiieeeeeeees...!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Nngh! Please! Stop! I never meant for this
 to happen! It was just a harmless prank! It was supposed to be funny!
But this isn't funny at all!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [normal] Exactly!
</dd><dd>[splats]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What? Wait... What's happening?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Just delighting in pranking the prankster.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [chuckles] Yeah. How does it feel to get some of your own medicine?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: So... you're... <i>not</i> sick? None of you are?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Of course not, silly!
</dd><dd><b>Crowd</b>: Gotcha!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: This... was all... a <i>prank</i>?!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Yep! And you can thank Pinkie Pie. After you
told her about your plan to prank the whole town, she got everypony
together and came up with a way to turn the tables on you.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Aw, shucks, it was nothing! Just a little something I threw together.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh...
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Wow! You should see your face!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: [laughs] Talk about funny!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [scoffs] Well, <i>I</i> don't think it's very funny! And <i>I'm</i> the one that got pranked! I was really scared! I thought I made everypony sick! You can't just go around—
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: —pranking whoever you feel like?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Without thinking about how it might make them feel?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Or if they'd even enjoy it?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: <i>Or</i> think it's funny?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah! [beat] Ohhh. I see what you did there.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Pranks can be a lot of fun when everypony has a good time. I thought you just needed to see what it's like when they don't.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I guess I did. I'm sorry, everypony. I haven't really been thinking about how other ponies feel.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Well, I hope you learned your lesson.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Totally! You ponies pulled off an amazing prank! I'll have to work extra hard to top it!
