<dl><dd><b>Main cast</b>: [chattering excitedly]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Can you believe the new baby is finally here?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Cup Cake and Carrot Cake must be so proud!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I wonder if it's a filly or a colt?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I wanna see the new baby pony! I wanna see! Which one is it?!
</dd><dd><b>Mr. Cake</b>: Meet our son, Pound Cake.
</dd><dd><b>Pound Cake</b>: [yawns]
</dd><dd><b>Main cast</b>: Awwww.
</dd><dd><b>Mr. Cake</b>: ...<i>and</i> our daughter, Pumpkin Cake.
</dd><dd><b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [yawns]
</dd><dd><b>Main cast</b>: Huh?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Two new foals for me to play with? [gasps] That's two, two, two times the fun! <i>This is the greatest day ever</i>! We need to celebrate your birthday, babies, 'cause you were just born today! Woo-hoo!
</dd><dd><b>Nurse Redheart</b>: Shhh. The babies are trying to sleep.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: But I was just–
</dd><dd><b>Nurse Redheart</b>: Shhh.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: But–
</dd><dd><b>Nurse Redheart</b>: Shhh!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [quieter] Happy happy birthday to you and you today–
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Now how in thunderation is one of them twins a Pegasus and the other one a unicorn?
</dd><dd><b>Mr. Cake</b>: Easy. My great-great-great-great grandfather
was a unicorn, and Cup Cake's great aunt's second cousin twice removed
was a Pegasus. That makes sense, right?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Aw, yeah! Heh, just you wait! Once little Pound Cake there gets his wings going, he'll be all over the place.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And be careful around Pumpkin Cake.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Baby unicorns get strange magic surges that come and go.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Quick! Make a wish and blow out your candles! Which is easy, 'cause there are zero candles! You are zero years old, after all!
</dd><dd><b>Nurse Redheart</b>: Shhh!

</dd><dd><b>Mr. Cake</b>: Gh, quick, honeybun, we need to find a babysitter to watch the foals while we take care of this.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I could do it! I wanna do it! Oh, the babies love playing with me, I'll do it!
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: I wonder who would be available on such short notice.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Me! Me! Pick me!

<dl><dd>[doors bang]
</dd><dd><b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Mr. Cake</b>: Now, Pinkie, are you sure you really understand the responsibility of watching over two babies?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I can be responsible. Why, responsibility is my middle name. Pinkie Responsibility Pie.
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: But this time you need to <i>take care of them</i>, not just play with them. You have to be responsible.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yes, I know. I will. I am.

</dd><dd>[applause]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hey, you're a wonderful crowd here tonight!
Where y'all from? Wow, that's great. Y'know, I used to have an ant farm,
 but I had to get rid of it because... I couldn't find tractors that
small!
</dd><dd>[ba-dum tish]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Get it? Tractors that small? [pause] The other day, I spilled spot remover on my dog... and now I can't find him!
</dd><dd>[ba-dum tish]
</dd><dd><b>Pound Cake</b> and <b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [crying]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Gee, tough crowd. [to herself] Tell me about
 it. Fine, I wasn't gonna pull off a show stopper, but you're a lovely
audience and I think you deserve it!

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hi! I finished up the work I had to do, so I thought I'd stop by and see if you needed any help. Whoa!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Thank you, thank you, thank you for coming! I
 can't begin to tell you what my day has been like! I mean, these babies
 just won't listen to reason, and don't even get me started on their
taste in stand-up comedy.
</dd><dd>[ba-dum tish]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's okay, Pinkie. I figured you would need some help. That's why I stopped by.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ex-<i>cuse</i> me?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Babies take a lot of work, and some ponies are just not cut out to handle the responsibility.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Is that so? Well, thanks for stopping by, Twilight. Sorry, I don't have time to visit. I'm very very busy with my <i>responsibilities</i> here.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm happy to help! It's no trouble–
</dd><dd>[door slams]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Well, of all the– She thinks I can't handle things on my own! Maybe because I haven't handled things on my own. Well, I <i>can</i> handle things on my own!

</dd><dd><b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [giggling and numing]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Pound Cake. [growls] This is a crib. It is
only to be used for napping, sleeping, and on occasion with permission,
as a pretend old-timey Western fort. It is <i>not</i> a trampoline, so stop your jumping right now, mister!
</dd><dd><b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [giggling]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: And you, young filly. We do not put anything
 in our mouth that we cannot safely and properly digest, so stop
slobbering on that toy this instant!
</dd><dd>[toy squeaks]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Now, we've all had a very exhausting afternoon, and it's time for all good little foals to take their nap. So, <i>fall asleep</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Pound Cake</b> and <b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [snoring]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [sighs] [kisses twice] Sleep tight.
</dd><dd>[toy squeaks]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Now that's what I call handling things. [gasps]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh, nononono. Not good, not good, not good! Pound? Pumpkin? Where are you? Come out, come out, wherever you are!
</dd><dd>[toy squeaks]
</dd><dd><b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [squeaks toy]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Whoa! You be a good little girl now, Pumpkin-wumpkin, and stay in your crib for your pal Pinkie-winkie!
</dd><dd><b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [squeaks toy repeatedly]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Pound Cake? [clicks] Here, Pound Cake!
</dd><dd>[wind blowing]
</dd><dd><b>Pound Cake</b>: [echoed giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Uh, Pound Cake? Uh...

</dd><dd><b>Pound Cake</b>: [echoed giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [squeaks toy; sound gets lower and more sinister]
</dd><dd>[<i>Psycho</i> chords play]
</dd><dd><b>Pound Cake</b>: [giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [squeals] You can fly?!
</dd><dd><b>Pound Cake</b>: [giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh... get down here... this instant... young... colt! [gasps for breath] I'm responsible for you!
</dd><dd>[suction cup noises]

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No no.
</dd><dd><b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: Nom.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No. Hmph! I am the responsible one, and I said no.
</dd><dd><b>Pound Cake</b>: Wheeee!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: That goes for you too, Pound Cake!
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Gotcha! I <i>think?</i> [yelping]
</dd><dd>[thudding on stairs]
</dd><dd>[splats]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Mm, razzleberry. I'm- not- letting- go! I'm- re-spon-si-ble!
</dd><dd>[thudding on stairs]
</dd><dd>[elastic stretching]
</dd><dd><b>Pound Cake</b> and <b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [giggling]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh, not you too! There! <i>Now</i> who's the responsible one?
</dd><dd><b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [jubilant giggling]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [yelps] [sobbing]
</dd><dd>[ploof]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [giggles] Y'know, you're right. That <i>is</i> funny.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pound Cake</b>: [snoring]
</dd><dd><b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [sleepy mumbling]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i>
</dd><dd><i>I've always had fun playing with little kids, and I thought
babysitting meant just more playtime, right? Wrong! Being a caregiver is
 way more responsibility than just being a playmate. And today, I
learned that sometimes our desire for responsibility can outrun our
actual ability to handle it.</i>

<dl><dd>[bell rings]
</dd><dd><b>Mr. Cake</b>: Pinkie Pie! We're back!
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: How did everything go? [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Mr. Cake</b>: Are we in the right place?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Shhh!
</dd><dd><b>Pound Cake</b>: [snoring]
</dd><dd><b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [sleepy mumbling]
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: P-Pinkie. This is just... just...
</dd><dd><b>Mr. Cake</b>: Amazing is what it is. We had no idea how
responsible you really are. Would you be interested in becoming our
go-to babysitter on a permanent basis?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] Hm- Ah- lemme check my schedule! I should be available a week from... never!
</dd><dd><b>Pound Cake</b> and <b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [sighs]
</dd><dd><b>Pound Cake</b>: Pinkie...
</dd><dd><b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: Pie...
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [happily gasps] I have some free time next Tuesday.
