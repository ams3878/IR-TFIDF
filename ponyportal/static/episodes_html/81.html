meta[ title:It Ain't Easy Being Breezies, lines: 534]
<dl><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Okay, everypony. As you know, the adorable fairy creatures known as Breezies are about to come through Ponyville.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yes! Ooh, it's so exciting! Ah! I can't wait
 for Rainbow Dash to make the breeze for them so I can see how cute they
 are up close!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I've never done it before, not that I won't be totally awesome at it, because I totally will!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: And that breeze is very important, but so is
 cheering on those teeny-tiny little things, so they have the confidence
 to ride that breeze to their native land. Did I mention how tiny they
are? So tiny! I was thinking we could do a special Breezie cheer!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I <i>love</i> cheers!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: But these cheers should be <i>quiet</i> cheers. We don't want to startle them. They need to be able to concentrate. Why don't we try it? You can do it, Breezies.
</dd><dd><b>Rest of main cast</b>: [shouting] You can do it, Breezies!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, my.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Heh, sorry, Fluttershy. I had no idea how hard it was to do a cheer quietly.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, it's okay. Quiet doesn't come naturally for everypony. Let's try it again.
</dd><dd><b>Rest of main cast</b>: [quieter but still loudly] You can do it, Breezies!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Perhaps just a little bit quieter.
</dd><dd><b>Rest of main cast</b>: [quieter] You can do it, Breezies!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Just a little quieter.
</dd><dd><b>Rest of main cast</b>: [practically whispering] You can do it, Breezies!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [loudly] Perfect! Oh, um, I mean... yay.

</dd><dd>[wind blowing]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That's too strong! We gotta slow this breeze down or we're gonna blow those Breezies apart!
</dd><dd><b>Mr. Cake</b>: What I don't understand is why they need the Pegasi to make a breeze for them.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Well, you see, it's the breeze that
activates the Breezies' magic, and that magic protects the pollen
they're carrying from being destroyed.
</dd><dd><b>Mr. Cake</b>: So, no breeze means no magic means the pollen goes bad?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: That's right! And they only have two days to
 get that pollen back before the portal to their home closes. That's why
 it's ever-so-important that we help them make their way through
Ponyville safely.
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: We certainly wouldn't want to scare them and divert them from their path!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Now you understand.
</dd><dd><b>Mr. Cake</b>: Hm, you certainly know a lot about them.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, thank you. I went to see them gathering
their pollen in Western Equestria. Um, Rarity? I, uh, hate to weigh in
with you when it comes to fashion, but...
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, there's too much purple on this, isn't there? I <i>knew</i> it! But Twilight refused to admit it.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What?! I-
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, no-no-no-no-no. It's the perfect amount of purple. It's just that there's an <i>awful</i> lot of sequins on your jacket.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, darling, please! One can never have too many sequins! [chuckles]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: You can if they reflect the sun, and the
light catches a group of Breezies right in their eyes, and blinds them
long enough to get them off their course so they never get home!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I stand corrected! I suppose there is the rare
instance where one can have too many sequins. I'll just take off my
jacket. I suppose this won't do either?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [whispering] Everypony, it's time. Please welcome... the Breezies!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: They're as cute as Apple Bloom on the day she was born.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: And would you look at those adorable little packs they carry their pollen in?
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: <i>Lun! Arshen aifok!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: So... cute! Can't... take... it!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [grunts] [hushed] Pinkie Pie, can I hop on you so I can see the Breezies?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [hushed, straining] May explode!
</dd><dd>[thunk]
</dd><dd>[wind blows]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh, no!
</dd><dd><b>Breezies</b>: [panicking]
</dd><dd><b>Crowd</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Slow down the breeze for the other group to catch up!
</dd><dd><b>Cloud Chaser</b>: They're too far back! We can't connect the breeze to both sets of Breezies!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What if we speed it up?
</dd><dd><b>Flitter</b>: Then the first group'll be going too fast, and they'll get separated from each other!
</dd><dd><b>Breezies</b>: [panicking]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Breezies</b>: [panicking]
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: <i>Tanagretu nik mir! Maisegu de piripa!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: <i>Mekenar stuf!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: He's right! You must all gather as close as you possibly can!
</dd><dd><b>Crowd</b>: [cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: <i>Mugudi saikendus?</i>
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, I understand the language of all kinds of creatures!
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: You must be so proud.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: And you speak <i>my</i> language too?
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: <i>I</i> can. This lot can only understand you. Clearly, they're not the brightest bunch around.
</dd><dd><b>Breezies</b>: [shouts of indignation]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: That was <i>amazing</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'm sorry we couldn't get a breeze going that would get them back to the others.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, it's not your fault.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I, for one, am very proud of you, Fluttershy. Leaping into action like that.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I feel like I should design you a special hero's gown! Heh... Or a sash. At least a sash.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Okay, okay, okay! I know what you're all
thinking! Why don't you just say it?! [crying] I'm sorry! This is all my
 fault! I'm so, so sorry!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, Spike, it's okay! It could have happened to any one of us.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Okay... Thank you!
</dd><dd><b>Breezies</b>: [shouting]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Uh... I'm... just... gonna stay over here.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: So, Fluttershy, you want us to get the breeze going again so these little guys can get a move on?
</dd><dd><b>Breezies</b>: [cries of protest]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Maybe we should wait just a moment or so. They've been through so much...
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Just gimme the word when you think they're ready.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Angel</b>: [whimpers]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, my, Twirly, you look like you need a blanket.
</dd><dd><b>Twirly</b>: <i>Sanken</i>
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, no problem.
</dd><dd><b>Breezie</b>: <i>Malenki?</i>
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, did you need some more water?
</dd><dd><b>Breezie</b>: [slurps]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Now, who else needed a hoof-knitted sweater?
</dd><dd><b>Breezies</b>: [cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hey there! Can we come in?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, of course! But watch your step!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Oop, sorry about that, little one.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We just wanted to see if you thought the Breezies were ready to give it another try.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Has it been an hour already? Oh, my
goodness! Time flies when you're making sure little creatures don't feel
 that you're abandoning them to the cruel world.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But they're not going to a cruel world, right? They're going home.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, yes, that's right!
</dd><dd><b>Breezies</b>: [cries of protest]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: On second thought, I don't think they're quite ready.
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: <i>Supa laipas data kurpa! Mise neku ersken laika maur! Siripat sulat!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh... what did he say?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I'd... rather not say.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Okay, well, I'm sure you know what you're doin'. No one knows rare magical creatures like you do.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We'll just wait for your word.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Thank you. I'll be in touch very soon.
</dd><dd>[door closes]
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: We need to go now, or we will never get home!
 I wish we did not need that stupid breeze to activate our magic, or I
would just force you all to fly home right now! Why do we have to need
magic to keep our pollen safe?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, now, Seabreeze-
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: Why are you giving in to these wimps?! If they had not been so scared in the first place, this never would have happened!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: But that is just not true, Seabreeze. It was because of a leaf, and you know that!
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: Oh, please! They have no idea what they're
doing out there! Like you said, we need as much time as we can get
because they are so incompetent!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Well, I didn't say that exactly now, did I?
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: Hmph!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, well, maybe a snack will lighten the mood.
</dd><dd><b>Breezies</b>: [coos of interest]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Breezies</b>: [chewing]
</dd><dd><b>Breezie</b>: [burp] <i>Mi fargen.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: You're excused. Well, my Breezies, I think
we can all agree that now that you've eaten and you have a little energy
 going in your breezy bodies, you're strong enough to face the breeze!
I've loved having you here, and I hope I've made you all feel loved and
special. But you have to go. Nopony here will deny that-
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: There is nothing special about these losers!
They cannot handle a simple breeze home! If they could just stick with
the program and listen to me, we would be safe! At home! Home, where
every Breezie is like us! [sighs]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Okay, well, a confusing pep-talk, but
nonetheless. I do know that if you don't leave soon, you may never make
it back, and that would be terrible!
</dd><dd><b>Breezie</b>: [sneezes] <i>Merte marshken farde.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Twirly</b>: [coughs] <i>Merki marshken plumatu.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I had no idea you all have colds! Really? All of you?
</dd><dd><b>Breezies</b>: [coughing]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, dear. I can't let you go out there sick! What kind of a friend would I be if I made you go now?
</dd><dd><b>Breezies</b>: [excited chattering]
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: <i>D'oh! Irde turten manes pudenhel! Nievo ut! Parde tarmen!</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[knocking]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hey, Fluttershy, just wondering if the
Breezies are ready to go yet. Clock's kinda ticking for them to make it
back before the door closes on their home.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, yes. I mean, not quite. Um, maybe just a few more minutes?
</dd><dd>[door closes]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, alright.
</dd><dd><b>Flitter</b>: We wait too much longer, we'll have to create such a strong breeze, it may be more than they can handle.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: We just have to trust Fluttershy. She must know what she's doing.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Breezies</b>: [excited chattering]
</dd><dd>[saxophone playing]
</dd><dd>[crash]
</dd><dd><b>Breezies</b>: Aww!
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: Why are you spending your time on this?! I will never get home!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Breezies, I must say, Seabreeze has a point.
 I think it's time for me to get Rainbow Dash and her friends so they
can create the breeze for you to get home.
</dd><dd><b>Breezies</b>: [dismayed shouts]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Ooh... You're all awfully anxious... Oh, I
don't want you to feel abandoned, or that I wasn't the most kind host I
could possibly be...
</dd><dd><b>Twirly</b>: <i>Adoshen papan gorn.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, yes, that does make sense... Seabreeze,
do you think you could wait just a couple more hou- Seabreeze?
Seabreeze? Has anypony seen Seabreeze? [gasps] Where's he going? There's
 no way he can handle being out there on his own!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[wind blows]
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: <i>Ah! Ah! Ah! Blusken! Ah! Ah! Arge nusen! Uf! Osemi! Ah! Narsken! Noi serenda! Ah!</i>
</dd><dd>[series of thumps]
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: <i>Ah! Gah! Ah! Kesino! Uu! Tu ge! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Miuse konda!</i>
</dd><dd>[squeak]
</dd><dd>[bees buzzing]
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: <i>Vaior uskren! Yavaya...</i>
</dd><dd>[bees buzzing]
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: <i>Ibeku-u-u! Ah, sa-sabada!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Excuse me, bees? Can you please back off my
Breezie friend? He didn't mean any harm. It was just an accident. I'm
working on a bee-type dance and was hoping you could help me? Does this
bring to mind any images for you? Perhaps a bee? Excuse me! I have done
nothing but be kind, but I guess that is <i>not</i> working! You bees know better than to hurt a helpless Breezie! I demand that you go away <i>now</i>, or you'll have to answer to <i>me</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: <i>Menkyulen.</i> Thank you! Thank you so much! Thank you for coming after me!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Of course. You could've gotten seriously hurt out there. Ponyville is much too dangerous for you. One tiny acorn is a threat!
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: Yeah, I know! That is one reason why I have been trying to get us to go from the beginning!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, my goodness. I was just trying not to
hurt any creature's feelings, but my displays of kindness may have cost
you everything... [gasps] Time is running out, and you may never make it
 home!
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: That is exactly what I have been telling all of them! But they do not listen to me! Nobreezie ever listens to me!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Seabreeze, I understand your feelings are
hurt, but it's hard for them to hear you when you're shouting and being
mean. The message doesn't get across.
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: But what about those bees? You were not nice to them, and that was the only way they listened!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Yes, but they <i>had</i> to go, and they wouldn't listen to me any other way. We need to go, now!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: My dear Breezies, I had to rescue Seabreeze from serious harm, and now I know more than ever that you <i>must</i> leave before it's too late! You would never survive in Ponyville.
</dd><dd><b>Breezies</b>: <i>Erski parli polin!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I can't help you any more. In fact, I wasn't
 helping you at all by being nice. Oh... But the truth of the matter is
that I must be firm! You must go, now! [sniffs] [crying]
</dd><dd>[door closes]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[wind blowing]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: It's too strong!
</dd><dd><b>Flitter</b>: I can't do it any lighter!
</dd><dd><b>Cloud Chaser</b>: Neither can I!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Fly back! I'm gonna try and see if I can slow it down. Now it's too light! Oh, this will never get them home!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, my. Maybe it's because there are too few
 of them. When they started their journey, there was more of them to
face the breeze together.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I've been studying an old spell book
from the Castle of the Two Sisters. There's a spell that I think could
help us! This is probably gonna feel a little funny at first, but you're
 gonna have to trust me.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I <i>love</i> new ideas that make me feel funny at first!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Main cast</b>: [excited noises]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: <i>Maifo flai batendud!</i> [high-pitched] Um, I mean, let's go!

</dd><dd><b>Breezette</b>: <i>Marskin farskin.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Breezie</b>: <i>Metar.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: You can do this! I am sorry for how I treated
 you before! It was not right that I called you names! I did not even
really believe those things I said! I was worried we would never get
back to our home, and I lashed out... I know you can do this! I believe
in you! Hold on to me, let us join the group!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[wind blowing]
</dd><dd><b>Main cast</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [high-pitched] Holy mini-sized paradise!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [high-pitched] This is simply beautiful! So much inspiration. Where's my sketchpad when I need it?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [high-pitched] So...stinkin'...cute!
</dd><dd><b>Breezies</b>: [commotion]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [high-pitched] You okay, Fluttershy?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [high-pitched] I'm just so very happy they got to be reunited with their family!
</dd><dd><b>Breezies</b>: [commotion]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [high-pitched] We'd better get going before the entrance- well, exit for us, closes.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [high-pitched] Goodbye, Breezies. I must go now.
</dd><dd><b>Seabreeze</b>: To remember us by.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [high-pitched] Thank you! I'll miss you. I'll miss all of you! [voiceover, normal] <i>My
 experiences with the Breezies have helped me to see that kindness can
take many forms, and sometimes being too kind can actually keep a friend
 from doing what they need to do. Pushing them away may seem cruel, but
it's sometimes the kindest thing you can do.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [high-pitched] Whoa! That was a close one!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b> and <b>Rarity</b>: [agreeing]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [high-pitched] Okay, gather round.
</dd><dd>[magic zaps]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: So, uh, I've always kinda wondered what it would be like to be a griffon.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Not a chance.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You sure? What about a dragon? No? It doesn't have to shoot fire!
