</dd><dd><b>Opalescence</b>: [meowing]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Why, yes! I did make it myself. Thank you so much for asking.
</dd><dd><b>Opalescence</b>: [low growl]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, Opal, of course you can help me. Thank you.
What's that? You want to help me more? Oh, aren't you the sweetest
thing? Careful now. Don't move. This shouldn't take long at all.

<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Howdy, Rarity!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Shh... Can't you see Rarity is trying to concentrate?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: What do you think she's makin'?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Looks like a dress.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, that makes sense. Since this is a dressmaker's shop and all.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Is there something I can help you with?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, so very sorry to trouble you,
Rarity, but I need a quick favor. Could you please fix the button for
me? It's my dress for the Grand Galloping Gala.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, no, no, no! You can't wear this... old
thing. You need a glamorous new outfit for the Gala and I'll make it for
 you. No problem at all. It will be my pleasure!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, that's really sweet of you to offer, Rarity, but I can't let you do that. It would be so much work. This dress is fine.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Twilight Sparkle. I insist on making you a new dress.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But...
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Not another word! I won't take no for an answer.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, in that case... Thank you for your generosity, Rarity. Knowing your handiwork, I'm sure it will be absolutely beautiful.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Let me guess, Applejack. You don't want a new gown either.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Gown? Shoot. I was just gonna wear my old work duds.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: You can't possibly be serious, Applejack! You absolutely must wear formal attire.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hm... Nah.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: What if I just spruce up your... duds for you a little bit?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Okay, sure. Why not? Since you're up for it and all. Just don't make them too... frou-frou-y.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Deal!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Look out below!
</dd><dd>[crash]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Sorry. New trick. Didn't quite work.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Hmm... [gasp] Idea! I'll make you an outfit for the Gala too, Rainbow Dash.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Outfit for the what now?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I'll make one for you and you and all of you.
Oh! And of course Pinkie and Fluttershy too. Oh, and when I'm done, we
can hold our very own fashion show!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What a great idea! If you're sure you can handle it.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, it'll be a little bit of work, but it will be a wonderful boost for my business. Plus, fun!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh, I love fun things!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Then it's settled. We'll have a fashion show starring us.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: So all you have to do is make a different,
stunning, original, amazing outfit for one, two, three, four, five...
plus yourself, six ponies? And lickety split?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, Applejack. You make it sound as if it's going to be hard.

 your old duds now, Applejack? Pretty swanky, are they not? And
Twilight! I made this dress for you and I designed each outfit theme to
perfectly reflect each pony's unique personality. Oh, it took me forever
 to get the colors right on this one, Rainbow Dash, but I did it. Oh,
and it turned out <i>beautiful</i>, don't you think? And I know you are
going to love yours, Fluttershy. It just sings spring! And Pinkie Pie,
look! Pink! Your favorite! Aren't they all amazing?

</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: That's okay. Not a problem. There's plenty more

</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, it's no imposition. Really, I insist.

<dl><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Hello? You wanted to see me, Rarity?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Fluttershy! Your new-new gown's ready. I completely revised it and I know you're going to love it. What do you think?

[inhales] The armscye's tight, the middy collar doesn't go with the
shawl lapel, the hems are clearly machine-stitched, the pleats are
uneven, the fabric looks like toile, you used a backstitch here when it
clearly called for a topstitch or maybe a traditional blanket stitch,
and the overdesign is reminiscent of prêt-à-porter and not true French
haute couture. [pauses] But, uh... you know... um, whatever you want to
do is fine.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: What if it rains? Galoshes!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: More balloons! Oh no, that's too many balloons. More candy! Oh, less candy. Oh wait, I know. Streamers!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Streamers?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Whose dress is this?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Streamers it is.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Aren't you going to tell me to change something too?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: No, I just want my dress to be cool.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Do you not like the color?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: The color's fine, just make it look cooler.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Do you not like the shape?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: The shape's fine, just make the whole thing... you know, cooler. It needs to be about twenty percent cooler.

maybe I happened to mention it to him... He's coming here all the way
from Canterlot to see your work, Rarity!

<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh. [gasp] There he is! [deep breaths] Okay.
Relax, Rarity. Your friends like their outfits and so will he. [squeals]
 What's wrong with the lights?! Oh, yes. That means the show's starting.
 Good.
</dd><dd>[music]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Since the beginning of time, the elite of
Equestria have longed for pony fashions that truly expressed the essence
 of their very souls. Patiently waiting decades -- no, <i>centuries</i>
-- for the perfect pony gown. Today, at long last, Equestria, your wait
is over! Let's hear it for the breathtaking designs of Ponyville's own
Rarity!
</dd><dd>[ponies murmuring]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Why's everypony lookin' at us like that?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh dear.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You think we overdid it?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Nah. [pause] Okay, maybe a little.
</dd><dd><b>Hoity Toity</b>: Oh, those amateurish designs look like a
piled-on mishmash of everything but a kitchen sink! It's a travesty is
what it is. Those outfits are the ugliest things I've ever seen, oh for
shame. Who is responsible for subjecting our eyes to these horrors? Not
to mention wasting my valuable time.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b> [to Opal]: Oh! Hide me.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Come on out and take a bow, Rarity. You worked really hard for this. Yes! All right, woo-hoo! Go, Rarity!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Rarity? You okay in there? You haven't come out for days.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I'm never coming out! I can't show my face in
Ponyville ever again! I used to be somepony. I used to be respected. I
made dresses. Beautiful, beautiful dresses! But now everypony is
laughing at me. I'm nothing but a laughing stock! [sobs]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You're not a laughing stock, Rarity...
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: She kind of is.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Shhh! Come on out and talk to us.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [sobbing] Leave me alone! I vant to be alone! I
want to wallow in... whatever it is that ponies are supposed to wallow
in! Do ponies wallow in pity? Oh, listen to me, I don't even know what
I'm supposed to wallow in! I'm so pathetic!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Now what do we do?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Uh... panic?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That's your answer for everything!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, we can't just leave Rarity like this.

<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Exile... I guess technically I'd have to move
away to live in exile. Where would I go? And what would I pack? Oh, it's
 going to take me forever to do all of that packing. What are you
supposed to pack when you go to exile? Are you supposed to pack warm?

<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i>
</dd><dd><i>This week, my very talented friend Rarity learned that if
you try to please everypony, you often times end up pleasing nopony,
especially yourself. And </i>I<i> learned this: when somepony offers to
do you a favor, like making you a beautiful dress, you shouldn't be
overly critical of something generously given to you. In other words,
you shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.</i> [giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Hoity Toity</b>: Rarity, my congratulations to you on a most
 impressive fashion debut. Would you do me the great honor of allowing
me to feature your couture in my Best of the Best Boutique in Canterlot?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [gasp]
</dd><dd><b>Hoity Toity</b>: Now, I'll need you to make a dozen of each dress for me by next Tuesday.
