</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Is the banner even? Are the flowers in place? By
which I mean "completely out of view". I'm pretty sure dragons don't
like flowers. And what about the Ceremonial Dragon Fire Flame of
Friendship? Is it still flaming?
</dd><dd>[flame bursts]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike, everything looks great! You're getting yourself worked up for no reason.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I have <i>lots</i> of reasons. In fact, I wrote them down.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [sighs] You've been hanging around Twilight for too long.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [chuckles nervously]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Reason number one – I invited Dragon Lord Ember
to Ponyville today. Reason two – the Dragon Lord is a dragon. Reason
three – she's coming here to learn more about friendship.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: According to Ember's letters, the
dragons are trying to be friends, but competing is in their nature, and
it's leading to more and more fights.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Which brings me to to reason number four. The Dragon Lord wants <i>my</i> advice, and as the new official Equestrian friendship ambassador to the dragons, I can't let her down.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I know you feel a lot of pressure, but you've got this, Spike!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I... I just want things to be perfect.
</dd><dd>[tap, tap]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [gasps] Thorax! You're in Ponyville!
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Of course I am, silly! You invited me. And I'm not one to back out of an invitation. Hey, Twilight! Hey, Starlight!

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [whispering, to Spike] You invited Thorax over to Ponyville on the same day as Ember?!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Apparently.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: That doesn't seem like a good idea. How are you gonna entertain them both?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I have no idea. [whimpers]

<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: I completely forgot! Thorax wrote and said he
needed to talk, and I told him to come over. I didn't realize it was the
 same day I invited Ember! What am I gonna do?! [teeth chattering]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Well, maybe they'll like each other.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Probably not. Ember is tough and self-assured and intimidating. And Thorax is...
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Spike, I'm so glad you invited me! You are one
of my closest, nicest, most caring, most understanding friends ever!
Ooh! Is that ice in the shape of a dragon?
</dd><dd>[warbles]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Yeah, I see your point. They might not get each other.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Or worse – they'll <i>hate</i> each other! And if
 the leader of the changelings and the Dragon Lord get into a fight...
[gulps] I could be responsible for starting a war that could ruin
Equestria as we know it! [gasps]

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm sure that won't happen. Now pull it together.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: So, heh, Thorax, heh, everything good with you?
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Well, honestly, no. Not really. I have indigestion. Not sure if it's the new diet or stress. Or maybe it's both.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: No!
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Yeah, it really could be both. And it might be affecting my sleeping, too. I'm a real tosser and turner.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Uh-oh! [whimpers]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Sounds like you really need to unwind. Uh, how about a, uh... a trip to the castle? Heh. You can't miss that view.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yes, the castle! I'll give you a personal tour!
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Uh, aren't you coming?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Yeah, I'm just gonna... grab some ice cream for us and catch up. Heh-heh.

</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Dragon Lord Ember, as the official Equestrian friendship ambassador for the Dragon Lands <i>and</i>
 for Ponyville, I, Spike of Ponyville, welcome you to... uh, Ponyville.
[quietly, to himself] I gotta work on my official speech.
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Okay, thanks. [chuckles] Right. The hug thing.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [chuckles]
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: This place has a lot of colors. In the Dragon Lands, everything's just rocks or the color of ash. [sneezes]
</dd><dd>[ponies gasp]
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: That's probably why.
</dd><dd>[ponies screaming]
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Hey, Twilight!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Actually, I'm <i>Star</i>light. Starlight Glimmer. Nice to meet you.
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Oh, sorry. I'm really gonna have to get used to these pony names. Lots of "-lights" and shiny things. So, where is Twilight?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: She's in her castle. D'oh!
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: We should go visit her then. Part of friendship is saying "hi" to your friends, right?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Uh, well, yeah, but... [nervous stammering]
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: You're making weird noises. Do you have a stomachache?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Dah. I think I feel one coming on.
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Well, you know what us dragons say. "Push past the pain!" Now, let's go.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Or we could stay here.
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Or I could go without you.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [laughs] Ah, I like her.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Ohhh.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Good. They're not here.
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: What was that?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Uh, I... I said, "It's all clean in here!" Uh,
you must be hungry from your travels. Please, I'd love to present you
with an official friendship welcome banquet.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ember</b>: [crunching loudly] So this is something friends do? I could get used to this. [resumes chomping]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Actually, that's not food.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [aside] Dragons love gems!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Fine, but <i>you're</i> telling Twilight what happened to her wall.
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: [continues chomping]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Just keep her here. [to Ember] Okay, yeah! [laughs] Enjoy all the, uh... crystal... things!
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Where are you going? I thought this was an official friendship banquet.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Just gotta use the little dragons' room!
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: [chomps]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: So this is my comfy chair for fictional reads. [grunts] This is my studying chair because the hard back keeps me awake.
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Oh, Spike! I'm so glad you're here! [quietly]
This castle visit is getting weird. Twilight really likes chairs. Oh,
what happened to the ice cream?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: What? Oh, right! Uh, they ran out. Heh. Hey, I'm really sorry, but I gotta borrow Twilight quickly.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Aah!
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Be right back!
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: But we didn't get to talk yet! [groans]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: Ember's here!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I know. I saw you coming and had to
distract Thorax by showing him chairs. Why did you bring Ember to the
castle of all places?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I don't know! Ember was asking for you, Thorax
wants to talk with me. We need to switch places! They might be getting
suspicious.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: All we have to do is make both Thorax and Ember feel special and keep them apart for a few more hours. We can do this.
</dd><dd>[shimmering sounds]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Dah! What's happening?! [whimpers]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I think it's the map. It's calling... <i>you</i>. Apparently, you also have to solve a friendship problem!
</dd><dd>[dramatic sting]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: The map is calling <i>me</i>?!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, amazing! The map is really reaching out!
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Not a good time? I get it.
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Spike, are you here? Ember's eaten
all of Twilight's decorations, and—oh! Hey, Twilight! [chuckles, gasps]
Glowing map... [gulps] Glowing spikes... That's not good.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I know!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: At least your friendship problem is in Ponyville? Heh.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Okay, okay. To pull this off, I'm gonna need both
 of you to help. You two need to keep Ember and Thorax separate while I
get ice cream.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You mean "find the friendship problem".
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Yeeeees! Go easy on me. I'm under a lot of pressure.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: Friendship problem? Anypony gotta friendship
problem here? Any problems to solve? Friendship problems? Friendship
problems! Anypony got a friendship problem here? No? Okay.
</dd><dd><b>Lyra Heartstrings</b>: [grunts] Well, <i>I</i> think vanilla strawberry cream <i>is</i> overused!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Drops</b>: Hmph.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Yes! Fighting! Uh, I mean, what seems to be the problem?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ember</b>: Mmm. Mmm. I'm stuffed. [belches]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ember, there you are!
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Okay, right. More pony hugs.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: How's your trip to Ponyville so far?
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Well, I'm certainly learning a lot about
friendship. I had no idea it was polite to decorate your walls in your
friends' favorite foods!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [laughs nervously] Oh, my.
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Where'd Spike and Starlight go? I feel like I'm being avoided. [snorts]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Nooooo. They're just making sure
everything is perfect for your welcome party later. In the meantime, how
 about I show you around town?
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Sounds good. I can't exactly learn about friendship if I don't make new friends.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sighs]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Thorax</b>: [grunting, sighs]
</dd><dd>[door closes]
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Oh!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Uh, hey, Thorax. Um, Twilight and
Spike had some boring official paperwork to deal with, so looks like you
 and I get to hang out. What would you like to do?
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: But I wanted to talk with Spike. He said he'd be right back.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Oh, you will. But first, how about we grab a bite to eat?
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Huh. Well, you know, now that you've said it, I <i>am</i> a little hungry. Is there a dining room in the castle?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: No! I mean, yeah, but that's castle food. If you want the good stuff, we gotta go to town. Phew!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: ...and that's why you should never let cupcake flavors get in the way of your friendship.
</dd><dd><b>Lyra Heartstrings</b>: Huh. I guess I never thought of it that way. Thanks, Spike!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh, come on! Glow!
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Spike! There you are! Uh, done with your boring paperwork, I see.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [laughs nervously] Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Yep. [laughs] I am done with whatever Starlight says I was doing.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Thorax wanted to get out of the castle. I thought coming to town was a really, <i>really</i> great idea.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Well, maybe now we can talk.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Uh, sssssure.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I'll leave you guys to it.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: First of all, I want to say thank you for having me over. I'm in a bit of a leadership pickle, and I could use some advice.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Well, I definitely want to help you out as quickly as possible.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Here's my problem. There's this renegade group
of changelings who still feed off of love. Even though I said, "Hey
let's not do that anymore," they say, "Hey, this is how we've been doing
 things for hundreds of years..." [crossfades] ...but it's like they
don't want to, even though I'm the leader and I have to... [fades out]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[ponies sounding interested]
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Hello, I am Ember, daughter of Torch, winner of the Gauntlet of Fire, and lord of all dragons! [roars]
</dd><dd>[ponies scream]
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Usually when I do that, the dragons are <i>eager</i> to meet me.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That's not how <i>ponies</i> make friends.
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Ah, I get it.
</dd><dd><b>Derpy</b>: [slurps]
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: This is a weird friendship thing you ponies do, right?
</dd><dd>[splat]
</dd><dd>[honk!]
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Uh, you guys are in town, too?
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: What are you talking about? You've been with me this whole time.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: No. I'm <i>Star</i>light.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Riiiight. I'm sorry, but you can't blame me. You both look and act so much alike.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b> and <b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What?!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Thorax</b>: ...and they said to me they just keep saying the
same thing. You know, I think my leadership problem started in
childhood. I must've been three when... [crossfades] ...three's a
different story, a-and you've definitely gotta hear it. But the story
about my brother was when I was two... or was I one?
</dd><dd><b>Crusoe Palm</b>: This is <i>my</i> seat! I saw it first!
</dd><dd><b>"Rainbow Stars"</b>: Well, <i>I</i> got here first!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Thorax, uh, excuse me for a second.
</dd><dd><b>Crusoe Palm</b> and <b>"Rainbow Stars"</b>: [growl]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Ponies, please! If I may, I think I can help
solve this friendship problem. You two should sit together. You both
like the same place, you both ordered muffins, you're both ponies. I
think if you made a little effort, you'd find— Whoa! Okay, that had to
have done it. Come on, spikes. Glow! [strains, sighs]
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Hey, that was really great advice. So what do you think <i>I</i> should do?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [gasps] Uh, actually, I, uh... need a minute... alone... to, uh, <i>really</i> come up with great advice! [pants] I'll be right back.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: [sighs] Great. No problem. Leave me again. It's fine.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ember</b>: I'm just saying you're both purple ponies with purple hair. You both have cutie marks with sparkly things.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [chuckles] Mine's more of a <i>glimmer</i>. Heh.
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: How is that different? Oh, good. Spike. Can you please tell these two I'm right? They look very similar.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Uh... Well, y'know, one thing friends do is let something go when it's upsetting somepony else.
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: But I'm <i>right</i>! Besides, who are you to be telling me about friendship? I've barely seen you all day!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Uh, well, <i>I've</i> seen <i>you</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: <i>Are you calling me a liar?!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [chatters]
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Hey! No one yells at my friend!
</dd><dd>[transformation noise]
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: [bear growl]
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Spike, get away from the bear!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Actually, the bear is a changeling. And he's quite gentle.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Not anymore! [bear roar]
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: [roars]
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: [bear growl]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [screams] My worst fears are happening!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: <i>Noooo!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: [pants] Back away, Spike! I'm not gonna let this dragon harm a scale on your back!
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: <i>You</i> back away! I'm not gonna let <i>you</i> harm <i>him</i>! Wait. Did you say you're <i>not</i> gonna let me harm Spike?
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Yeah!
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: But that's what <i>I'm</i> doing!
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Uh, what?
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Yeah, what?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [panicked] Equestria as we know it is over! The
war that pits changeling against dragon is about to begin! And it's all
my fault! My title of Equestria's friendship ambassador is a lie—! Oh.
Hey. You guys aren't fighting?
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Why would we be fighting?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Because I accidentally invited you both over to Ponyville on the same day?
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b> and <b>Thorax</b>: So what?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: So I... was trying to keep you apart because I didn't think you'd get along.
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Oh. I get it. You thought he wouldn't like me just because I'm a dragon and I'm bad at friendship?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: No, no, of course not! But— Wait. Isn't that why you're here?
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: <i>I</i> can say I'm bad at friendship. <i>You</i> can't say it about <i>me</i>! You know what? I don't wanna talk about it.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Wait, please! [sighs] [to Thorax] I'm sorry.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: No, no, it's cool. You thought I would be too
soft, and someone like Ember would never respect me. Just like my own
changelings!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: No, that's not it! Thorax, wait! Oh, no... What have I done?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[splash]
</dd><dd>[kick]
</dd><dd>[splash]
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Why are <i>you</i> still here?
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: [sighs] Because I'm having trouble leading my pack, so I don't really wanna go home.
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Wait, you're in charge? [chuckles] Oh, boy. You need to be more assertive.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Well, that's my problem. I don't know how! I
tried asking them to please follow my directions. I even offered a
prize, and then—
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Shhh! Stop talking.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: That's how you do it.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Whoa! That just gave me chills.
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: I know you have it in you. You turned into a <i>bear</i> to defend Spike.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Huh, I guess I can be tough when I'm defending my friends, but when I'm just enforcing my rules, I-I feel unsure of myself.
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: There's nothing to be unsure of. You're the
leader for a reason. Make a decision and let it be known that the
decision is final. And if that doesn't work, turn into a bear.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Oh, well, that's good advice.
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: I know it is.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: So what's <i>your</i> deal? Why do you think you're so bad at friendship?
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: I don't want to talk about it.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Oh, you have to! How else are you gonna solve your problems?
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Through feats of strength and fire duels, of course. [grunts, roars]
</dd><dd>[explosion]
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Uh, how does that help?
</dd><dd>[crunch]
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Crushing another dragon in competition establishes my dominance and makes me feel <i>great</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Right, but, uh, how do you think <i>they</i> feel?
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Humiliated! Ashamed! They'd probably wanna run
away and bury themselves under a rock and... never come out. They're
probably sad. Kinda low. Definitely not happy.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: That's because that kind of competition can
divide you. And it doesn't get to the heart of the issue. Talking about
your feelings does.
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: [sneezes] Ugh! I think I'm allergic to feelings.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: You know you don't have to be sappy...
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: [blows]
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: ...or huggy-feely about it! But you should let your friends know how you feel.
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Uh, I know where we can start.
</dd><dd>[whoosh]
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Where? Ohhhh. Spike. Hah. I got there.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: I think they're gone. They probably never want to see me again.
</dd><dd>[thuds]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Or they want to see you now.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [gulps]
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Guess what, Spike.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I know. I'm so sorry.
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: <i>Let me talk about this!</i> I... feel... [strains] <i>mad</i>. [sighs]
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Okaaaay... That's a good first attempt. Now maybe try to be more specific?
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: [cracks limbs, breathes deeply] I'm... [sighs] <i>upset!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: You have every right to be.
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: <i>I know I do!</i> And I know I need to tell you how I feel because my friend Thorax said it would make me feel better. And it does!
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Yeah! And I have no problem telling you what you did was wrong because my friend Ember is helping me be more assertive!
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Whoa.
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Nice.
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b> and <b>Thorax</b>: Ha-ha!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: You guys <i>should</i> be mad at me. I was so
worried about how it could go wrong, I didn't even think about how it
could go right. [sighs] Can you forgive me?
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: I really do feel better. So, yeah. I'm good.
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: Hah. Me, too. [pleased sounds]
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: [groans] Again?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd>[spikes shimmering]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: No way! It's finally happening! I solved the friendship problem!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Actually, you <i>created</i> the friendship problem by not trusting your friends.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Yeah, but then I solved it by learning my lesson.
 I should have told my two friends about each other immediately instead
of assuming they wouldn't get along.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Good job, Spike.
</dd><dd><b>Ember</b>: Is this another part of pony friendship? Telling each other what you learned all the time?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>, <b>Starlight Glimmer</b>, and <b>Spike</b>: [giggling]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Yeah, pretty much.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Yup.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[ponies chattering]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [through loudspeaker] So, as a show of unity, I
present the Dragon Fire Flame of Friendship to both Dragon Lord Ember
and Thorax, leader of the changeling pack! May the flame of friendship
burn for eternity.
