<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: This happened while we were gone?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Wow! Those are all the places we went when we left to save Equestria!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Ugh! There's that horrid town where we were almost sold!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: The pirates! They were pretty awesome! Uh, once they decided not to throw us overboard.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: And Mount Aris! Ooh, Starlight! Did you know we made seashell necklaces for <i>aaaaaa</i>... [inhales] <i>...aaaaall</i> the seaponies?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I... You... Really? What about that unicorn? The one who attacked Canterlot?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Tempest! I invited her to come to
Ponyville, but she wanted to spread the word of the Storm King's defeat
and share what she learned about friendship.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Y'all think that's why the map grew? Friendship quests <i>beyond</i> Equestria?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I hope not. I've had quite enough life-threatening adventures, thank you very much.
</dd><dd>[squeaking]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: How many friendship quests do you think we need to go on before we have to expand the throne room?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We can't do it all alone.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Sure we can! We just need to knock this wall down, get some paint...
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No. I mean, the world is filled with
so many different creatures who know nothing about friendship. We need
help if we're gonna teach them all about friendship. <i>Lots</i> of help.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Perhaps. But where does one go to <i>learn</i> about friendship?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Here! They can all go here! Because we're gonna open a school!

<dl><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: I think a school of friendship is a wonderful idea, Twilight! I'll help in any way I can.

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I just have a few questions. What time should school start each day?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: It really d—
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What's the ideal length for class? Do you test regularly?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Oh, well, that's—
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What about class projects?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: That's a very—
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Assigned seating? Open seating? Or is that... too unstructured?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: [giggles] Oh, Twilight. You were my star pupil. If anyone knows how to run a school, it's you.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: There's a big difference between attending a school and running one. It's not like there's a rule book to follow.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Actually, there is. The EEA guidebook is very specific about how to run a school.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The EEA? I've never heard of that. Should I have heard of that?!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Of course not. You've never run a
school before. The Equestria Education Association is a board of learned
 ponies that oversee every school in Equestria.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Even your school? But you're you!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Not even a princess can do whatever
she likes when it comes to shaping young pony minds. The EEA ensures
that whether it's unicorns studying magic, Pegasi learning weather, or
Earth ponies researching agriculture, all schools are held to the same
high standard. They'll need to approve your plan before you can move
forward.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Okay, Spike, looks like we have a presentation to make.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [scoffs] After everything we've been through, how hard can <i>that</i> be?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[deep chord]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I'm gonna go with "really hard".
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Uh, hello. My name is—
</dd><dd><b>Neighsay</b>: Princess Twilight Sparkle. I am Chancellor
Neighsay. Equestria owes you a great debt. But princess or no, we expect
 you to do things by... the... book!
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd>[pages flipping]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I think you'll find my curriculum meets all your requirements, Chancellor.
</dd><dd>[pages flipping]
</dd><dd><b>Neighsay</b>: And can we trust you to follow through with
this plan? Will you leave the school unattended to gallop off on your...
 "adventures"?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: My journey beyond Equestria showed me firsthoof that the threats out there are greater than we imagined!
</dd><dd>[EEA members hushed whispering]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: If we want to keep our land safe and create a friendlier tomorrow, we need to teach the Magic of Friendship far and wide.
</dd><dd><b>Neighsay</b>: A school for <i>ponies</i> to learn how to protect themselves.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Uh, more like respecting differences and communicating.
</dd><dd>[long pause]
</dd><dd><b>Neighsay</b>: The EEA concurs. Every pony should be prepared to defend our way of life. So, if your work is in order, <i>provisional</i> EEA approval is granted. We will need to observe your school up and running before it can be fully accredited.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Then please, join us for Friends and Family Day. It'll be the perfect time to see our progress!

</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Not your dress! This! Us! Teaching?! They're gonna think I'm an egghead!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Well, the students are gonna <i>love</i> my confetti cannon class. It's gonna be... a blast!
</dd><dd>[party cannon squeak]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, hello there. I'm your teacher. I hope you enjoy class. But if you don't enjoy it, that's okay, too.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I don't know about all this.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's going to be fine. Everything about this school just feels right.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: See? If Twilight isn't stressed, you've got nothing to worry about.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: And you're sure you want <i>us</i> to be teachers? In classrooms?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The EEA is very clear on how schools should be run. We have a <i>huge</i> responsibility, and I need you all to do this by the book. That means no cannons in class, Pinkie.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Awww. Not even a [high-pitched] teeny cannon?
</dd><dd>[tiny party cannon fires]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I know it's not some big adventure
against the forces of evil, but this could be the most important thing
we've ever done. I can't run a school of friendship without my best
friends. Can I count on you?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Of course you can, darling.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Call me Professor Egghead. I'm in!
</dd><dd>[bell rings]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [screams] First day at school! So many new ponies!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: About that. One thing I forgot to mention. It's not just ponies.
</dd><dd>[students chattering]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: That was unexpected.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Ooh! Students certainly traveled from far and wide to attend our school!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Princess Celestia helped me reach out
to all the kingdoms. After all, friendship is something that needs to be
 shared with every... creature.

I'm your headmare Twilight Sparkle. Please follow Guidance Counselor
Starlight to sign in and get your class assignments. Then we can show

</dd><dd><b>Sandbar</b>: Whoa, sorry! I'm Sandbar. Are you a student here, too?
</dd><dd><b>Gallus</b>: [sarcastically] No, I just figured I'd randomly stand here and see how many ponies would walk into me. [huffs]
</dd><dd><b>Grampa Gruff</b>: <i>Gallus!</i> [wheezes]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Grandpa Gruff? What are you doing here?
</dd><dd><b>Grampa Gruff</b>: Flew all the way from Griffonstone to introduce Gallus.
</dd><dd><b>Gallus</b>: Rainbow Dash, right? Gilda told me about you. You're a teacher? Huh. Thought you'd be... cooler.

</dd><dd><b>Prince Rutherford</b>: <i>Ponies!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Prince Rutherford!

</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: I told you, stay in your own form. It's the polite thing to do. Sorry, she's shy.
</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: What is <i>that</i>?! No way! I didn't know ponies could turn into... um... What are you?
</dd><dd><b>Thorax</b>: A changeling.
</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: Ponies can turn into changelings?!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: No, but changelings can turn into ponies.
</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: Huh. That's confusing!
</dd><dd>[changeling zap]
</dd><dd><b>Seaspray</b>: I am General Seaspray of Her Majesty Queen Novo's navy. I would like to introduce the queen's niece, Silverstream.
</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: This place is <i>amazing!</i> I've spent most of my life in a coral reef underwater. I was a seapony, but now I'm a Hippogriff. Long story. Anyway, <i>wow!</i> Is that a yak?!

</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: That was sarcasm, right? Because you weren't being sweet <i>or</i> nice!
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: Maybe dragons and griffons are just too tough for friendship.
