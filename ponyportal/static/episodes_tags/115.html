</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Wow, Applejack! Are you sure you've never managed a concert before?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, it turns out doin' up a concert's the same as settin' up a rodeo.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And thanks to Pinkie's connections
organizing the Ponypalooza Rock Concert, we've got quite a lineup for
the Helping Hooves Music Festival.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Twilight! Applejack! Rainbow Dash! Rarity! Fluttershy! Spike! Pinkie Pie! Oh wait, that's me. <i>Everypony!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What is it, Pinkie?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I have the most amazing news ever! It is totally gonna freak your frizz!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, spill it, Pinkie!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: It wasn't easy. In fact, it was terribly
difficult. But I have managed to book the biggest pony pop star in all
of Equestria as the main attraction of the Helping Hooves Music
Festival!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Sapphire Shores?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Sapphire Shores?! Please! Sapphire Shores is merely the <i>second</i> biggest pony pop star in Equestria. I have booked the one, the only, <i>Countess Coloratura!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>, <b>Rainbow Dash</b>, <b>Rarity</b> and <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ahhh...
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Who in the hay is Countess Coloratura?
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Drops</b> and <b>Lyra Heartstrings</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Amethyst Star</b>: [gasps]

<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Pinkie Pie, who is this Countess Coloratura pony?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Uh, I just <i>told</i> you that she's the biggest pony pop star in Equestria! How-how-how-how-<i>how</i> have you not heard of her?!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Don't know. Though I did know a gal named
Coloratura when I was just a filly. [laughs and snorts] Wouldn't it just
 be the funniest thing if <i>that</i> Coloratura and <i>this</i> Coloratura were the same Coloratura? Heh.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Do you mean to tell me that you actually <i>know</i> Countess Coloratura?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, I don't think it's the same pony, since my friend wasn't any sort of high-falutin' countess.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Do you remember her cutie mark?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Sure do. It had this super colorful bunch of musical notes that just shimmered in the light.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You mean... like <i>this</i>?!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, fancy that! That there's the very same cutie mark!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Do you have any idea the number of hoops I
had to jump through to get her to perform at the festival?! A whole lot
of hoops! That pony is very demanding!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Nah.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>Yah!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I completely understand. We <i>artistes</i> require certain necessities in order to do our best work.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: This was clearly some sort of misunderstandin', 'cause Rara was just as down home as me!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>, <b>Pinkie Pie</b>, <b>Rainbow Dash</b>, <b>Rarity</b>, <b>Royal Riff</b>, <b>Spike</b>, <b>Sprinkle Medley</b> and <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Rara?!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Even that big name was too fancy for her, so I shortened Colo<i>ra</i>tu<i>ra</i> to "Rara"!

</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [voiceover] We had the best time at Camp Friendship!

</dd><dd>[splashing]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [voiceover] Rara and I prepared this song for
 the camp talent show. When we performed, she belted it out, singin' in
the most colorful, clear voice I'd ever heard!

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: ...then we lost touch. But Rara always did
want to go to Manehattan to try and make it big. But a demandin' diva?
Just you wait, Pinkie. Once Rara gets here, you'll see she's just a
plain old pony like you and me.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I don't have to wait – <i>she's here!</i>

</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: AJ?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Yeah! Heh. Howdy, Rara!
</dd><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: [unintelligible whispering]

</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Hoofsies! [short laugh]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Ooh, you got hoofsies from Countess Coloratura! Look! Ooh, she clearly thinks you're very special!
</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Hoofsies! Hoofsies! Hoofsies! [short laugh]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Yeah... real special.
</dd><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: Now <i>that's</i> how you make an entrance! Big, bold, absolutely stunning! Though it was <i>muddied</i> a bit with your interaction with that dusty farmpony. Do you actually <i>know</i> her?
</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Oh, yeah, that's my childhood fillyfriend AJ! She was the one that started calling me Rara.
</dd><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: Oh, yes, how cute and... <i>common</i>. Of course, <i>I</i> was the one that started calling you <i>Countess</i>,
 and just look at how you've moved up in Equestria since then! Why,
you've gotten everything you've ever wanted! Speaking of which, where is
 the pony Pinkie Pie?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ooh! I'm the pony Pinkie Pie, Mr. Manager, sir!
</dd><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: Do you have the water imported from Rainbow Falls that I requested for Countess Coloratura?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I have twenty glass containers full right here!
</dd><dd>[clink]
</dd><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: Did I not tell you to provide straws in all of Countess Coloratura's beverages?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Uh, I don't think so. But lucky for you, I have the biggest straw collection in Equestria! I call this straw <i>Fernando</i>.
</dd><dd>[flamenco music]
</dd><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: Hm. Let us confirm that you acquired the
rest of the items that Countess Coloratura requested before she performs
 her run-through, shall we?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ooh, we shall!
</dd><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: Floral arrangements from the royal Canterlot
 gardens... Chocolate éclairs made by Gustave le Grand... A selection of
 crystals from the Crystal Empire... Freshly picked cherries from Cherry
 Jubilee's farm separated red from yellow...
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Abso-toot-ly!
</dd><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: Well, by some miracle, your requests have been reasonably met. So let us move on... to rehearsal!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: See, Applejack? Demanding!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Pinkie's right, Rarity! The Rara I knew
didn't hide behind a veil givin' out fake stamp kisses, sippin' up
imported water, and needin' her cherries separated.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, I do understand. Sometimes it's hard to see our friends change.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: She's become a whole other pony!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Trust me. Once you see Countess Coloratura perform, you simply won't believe it!

</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Rarity was right! I <i>don't</i> believe it!
</dd><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: Oh, my shining star! Thanks to the sparkling costumes, dazzling choreography, and brilliant vocal effects that <i>I</i> designed, your performance was <i>spectacular</i>, Countess Coloratura!
</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Oh, [short laugh], thank you, Svengallop!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Correct me if I'm wrong here, but that feller
 isn't actually complimentin' Rara. He's complimentin' all the bells and
 whistles he's piled on to make her Countess Coloratura.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, no-no-no-no-no, you don't understand,
Applejack. Creating all those elements is a lot of work, and Countess
Coloratura's performance wouldn't exist without them.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: If you ask me, that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Oh, if we're all done here, I'd love to go back to my trailer and rest, Svengallop.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Actually, right now you're scheduled for your meet and greet with the schoolponies!
</dd><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: Ugh. I can <i>totally</i> get you out of meeting with the schoolponies, Countess.
</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Absolutely not. My favorite part of any event is meeting with the schoolponies!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: The schoolponies'll be so happy to hear that, Rara!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Ponyville schoolponies! As part of the Helping Hooves Music Festival, I'm holding a contest where some of <i>you</i> will get a chance to sing with <i>me</i> onstage at the concert tomorrow! Sound fun?
</dd><dd>[foals cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Alright! Now who wants more hoofsies?
</dd><dd>[foals cheering]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Now <i>that's</i> more like the Rara <i>I</i> remember.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [distant] But... I got everything you requested!
</dd><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: <i>That</i> was for Countess Coloratura! <i>This</i> is for <i>me</i>! And what <i>I</i> want is <i>premium</i> oats!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh! Well, we have lots of tasty oats right here in Ponyville!
</dd><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: I would not feed those to a chicken! I want top-of-the-line Appleloosan oats! Next, it appears that we are surrounded by <i>apple</i> trees. Bring me five hundred pre-peeled, pre-cored apples, and I want those things in twenty-four hours!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] But that's impossible!
</dd><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: Do you want me to <i>pull</i> Countess Coloratura from your little <i>podunk charity show</i>?! Because I will!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Applejack! Svengallop just made all of these new demands and he said—
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I heard, Pinkie. But don't you fret. I'll talk to Rara and fix things right up.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Did'ja see, sis?! Did'ja see?!
</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Is this the little sister you wrote to me about, AJ?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Hold on, Applejack. You wrote to Countess Coloratura about <i>me</i>?!
</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: AJ said you were the best little sister ever, Apple Bloom!
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Alright now, you'd best get along, little ponies.
</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: [laughs]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh... Hey, Rara, you mind if I talk to you about your manager?
</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Sure, what about him?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, while you were meetin' with the schoolponies, he was demandin' all sorts of stuff from Pinkie Pie.
</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Svengallop works very hard as my
manager, AJ, so if he needs some things when we're on the road, I don't
see anything wrong with that.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, do you see somethin' wrong with him
tellin' Pinkie that if she doesn't get those things by tomorrow, he'd
pull you from our charity festival?
</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: What? But he knows how important charity is to me, and leaving the festival would completely ruin my image!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I'm afraid <i>Svengallop</i> doesn't give a pickled pippin about your charity work.
</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: That's not true! Svengallop has
always supported me in all my interests. You're just saying those things
 because you're jealous!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Jealous of what? A pony who hides behind a
veil so thick she can't see when somepony's usin' her? No, I'm not
jealous of that, Rara!
</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: I am not Rara! I am Countess Coloratura! And while we may have been friends when we were young, we have <i>clearly</i> gone in different directions!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[squeaking and spinning]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: It just ain't right! He's manipulatin' her, and she's just not seein' it!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Enough stewin', more peelin'!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Sorry, Pinkie, but there is no way I'm lettin' that lousy Svengallop use my friend like that!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [groans]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Countess Coloratura!
</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Wow, AJ, you said my real name.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I said your <i>new</i> name, but I saw the
real you hangin' out with those schoolponies yesterday. And I know
somepony that'd prefer if you stop doin' those little events.
</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Ugh, not this again.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Come on now. You've just got to give me a chance to prove what I'm sayin' is true.
</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: And just how are you going to do that?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Do exactly what I say. We'll see if that Svengallop truly has your best interests at heart.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Svengallop? Svengallop! Where are you, Svengallop?
</dd><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: Here I am! Did you need something?
</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Yes, I was... considering... m-maybe cancelling the contest with the schoolponies...?
</dd><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: Countess, this is wonderful! I've been waiting forever for you to cancel that pointless schoolpony contest.
</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: You... have?
</dd><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: You do it at every charity event, and it does absolutely nothing to promote the Countess Coloratura image that <i>I</i> built! Consider it cancelled. Pinkie Pie!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [out of breath] Yes, Svengallop, sir! [coughs]
</dd><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: We are making some adjustments to the show. Follow me!
</dd><dd>[magic twinkling]
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: Cancel the contest for the fillies and
schedule me a spa treatment. Now that I don't have to oversee a
rehearsal with those brats, I have time for the works! You know the
drill! Deliver, or the diva ditches your dippy charity!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: Okay, Countess Coloratura, all taken care of!
</dd><dd>[audio feedback]
</dd><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: [amplified] <i>You know the drill! Deliver, or the diva ditches your dippy charity!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: So <i>that's</i> how you've been managing things?
</dd><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: Yeah, so? What's the problem?
</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: The problem is, is you've been using my name to intimidate ponies to get what you want!
</dd><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: But I work incredibly hard for you! I deserve everything I get!
</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: But not because you scare ponies
into thinking I won't perform for their charities otherwise! I would
never do that to my fans! Which is why you should have known that I
would <i>never</i> cancel the schoolponies' contest!
</dd><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: Hmph. All this charity and schoolpony contest nonsense is just remnants of that boring little <i>Rara</i> I met back in Manehattan!
</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: You clearly don't understand the real me!
</dd><dd><b>Svengallop</b>: Ha, that's a joke! I made you somepony! What can you even do without <i>me</i>? Good luck, <i>Countess Coloratura! Good luck.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Oh, Rara, I'm so sorry. Are you gonna be okay for the concert tonight?
</dd><dd><b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Of course. After all, the show must go on!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Coloratura</b>: Oh, my gosh, Rarity, Svengallop's right! This is gonna be a disaster! I'm gonna be terrible!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Can you give us a minute, Rarity?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Certainly.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Now, why's it gonna be so terrible?
</dd><dd><b>Coloratura</b>: Because Svengallop was in charge of everything! The lights, the visuals, the sound! Without Svengallop, I have nothing!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Now, now, don't go gettin' yourself into a
tizzy there, Rara. Svengallop turned you into Countess Coloratura and
acted like your friend so he could enjoy the perks that came with bein' a
 star. But the <i>real</i> perk of friendship is gettin' to see your
friend bein' true to their self. And Rara, when you're simply yourself,
you're the brightest star I've ever seen shine.
