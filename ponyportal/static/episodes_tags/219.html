</dd><dd><b>Unicorn Baker</b>: About Princess Twilight Sparkle's coronation? Who hasn't? I'm on my way there now. So much baking to do and—
</dd><dd><b><span title="as Crackle Cosette" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted">Queen Chrysalis</span></b>: No, no. [whispers] About the Earth ponies.
</dd><dd><b>Unicorn Baker</b>: I know their crops have been underperforming, but, uh...
</dd><dd><b><span title="as Crackle Cosette" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted">Queen Chrysalis</span></b>:
 That's not it. They're hoarding the food for themselves! I heard the
Mayor of Appleloosa say that if unicorns and Pegasi want to eat, they
can use their own hooves to dig.
</dd><dd><b>Unicorn Baker</b>: How awful!
</dd><dd><b><span title="as Crackle Cosette" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted">Queen Chrysalis</span></b>: We unicorns have to stick together, right? [sinister laughter]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[transformation zap]
</dd><dd><b>Lord Tirek</b>: Ah, Chrysalis. Another successful field trip, I presume?
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Spreading distrust among the unicorns
and Earth ponies is almost too easy. We could take down Twilight and her
 friends a hundred times, but as long as they have the "love" of
Equestria behind them, they'd crawl back to defeat us. Not anymore.
</dd><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: No friendship, no magic! It's so obvious when you think about it. I did my part freaking out the Pegasi.
</dd><dd><b>Lord Tirek</b>: And Grogar's long absence has given me time to prepare the next part of our plan. [blows]
</dd><dd>[grinding]
</dd><dd><b>Lord Tirek</b>: Grogar's Bell. This artifact can steal any
creature's magic. It holds that magic until it is released by this
spell. Which means all the power inside is ours for the taking!
[kissing]
</dd><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: You're drooling on the Bell.
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Let's try the spell before Grogar gets back. I'm sick of waiting for that old goat's master plan.
</dd><dd><b>Lord Tirek</b>: Take my hands.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Lord Tirek</b>: So we can all be part of the spell. Unless you'd prefer I take all the magic myself?
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Our pact stands. What we do, we do
together. Once we defeat the protectors of Equestria, we can claim this
land and rule our kingdoms <i>alone</i> once more.

<dl><dd><b>Grogar</b>: I have returned. Twilight Sparkle's coronation is
 today, and we are going to ruin it with this artifact. But to succeed,
you must work together.
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Oh, way ahead of you, Grogar. [spits]

</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [snapping fingers]
</dd><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: Wait. Discord was Grogar? Like, the whole time? Should we follow him?
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Without magic, he's no threat. Besides, we have plans.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Doesn't she look so adorably regal up there?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: Our little Twilight, all grown up. Should we tell her that we've cleared out our royal suites so she and Spike can move in?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Oh, maybe wait until after the coronation. Twilight doesn't need anything else to worry about today.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: So, you freakin' out yet?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: About what?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh, I don't know. It's not every day the
princesses that have ruled Equestria for hundreds of moons retire and
pass all their responsibilities on to your and your friends.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, that. Actually, I'm feeling pretty
 good. We've all faced so much and come out okay. I know we're up to the
 challenge of keeping Equestria safe and happy. There's nothing we can't
 handle together. Which reminds me...
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Royal advisor? What's that?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: A new position I created for you.
You've been at my side for every step of this journey. Knowing I had you
 to count on gave me the strength I needed to grow and succeed. I
wouldn't be here without you.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Thanks, Twilight. You know I'll always be your right-hoof dragon.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I was hoping you'd say that. Because now that my crown's been fitted, we have some royal errands to run!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[wind whistling]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: And you're sure this is where Pinkie told us to get the blackberries for her special coronation dessert?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Maybe they keep their produce in the back?
</dd><dd><b>Fruit Seller</b>: Nope. This is all we got. But I got a special on these taters.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [gags]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, no, thank you. We'll keep looking.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [gags, coughs] Ooh! Twilight, darling! You're
just in time. Only one more pre-coronation stop. We're picking up the
final touch for your <i>apres-hors d'oevres</i> gown...
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Is that before or after the royal marshmallow-eating-contest gown?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: What?! I haven't made one of those! You must tell me when they add these sorts of things!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [laughs] It's okay, Rarity. I was just joking.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Joking? Day of her coronation? You've come a long way, Twilight.
</dd><dd>[door jiggling]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, that's odd. They look open.
</dd><dd>[knock on door]
</dd><dd><b>Lemon Hearts</b>: What do you want?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh. Well, this being a thread shop, I thought I might buy some?
</dd><dd><b>Lemon Hearts</b>: Put the bits in the mail slot.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What was that about?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: You know designers. Don't like being interrupted
 when they're on a creative roll. With thread this exquisite, can you
blame them?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Weather for the coronation is sunny skies!
 It was weird, though. Not many Pegasi wanted to help me clear the
clouds. They were kinda on edge.
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd>[door closes]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: They're not the only ones.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: It's the first shift in royal power in over a millenium. Of course everypony is a little jumpy. Change does that.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: But I'm sure it's not because they're worried about you.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: How could they be? How many times have you saved their flanks by now?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You're right. I'll just have to let
everypony know that even with Celestia and Luna gone, we'll make sure
things stay the same.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Twilight! There you are! You mind tellin' your
 friend here that I don't need an official guard wherever I go?
Especially if he ain't gonna help carry apples?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I appreciate you taking such good care of my friends, but we're fine now.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: It was the strangest thing. He kept callin'
me "Earth pony", like I didn't have a name. And watchin' me like he
thought I'd steal the silver!
</dd><dd>[loud thud]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Do <i>not</i> go in that kitchen!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You look like you were in a sugar war.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: For some reason, the bakers are super
grouchy with each other. That unicorn chef started throwing dessert at
Mrs. Cake! I tried to help, but I got caught in the crossfire! Tasty,
tasty crossfire. [slurps]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You sure this is just pre-coronation nerves?
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: [groans] My aching metatarsals! You know, you forget how convenient snap-travel is.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Wait. Did you just walk here?
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Yes, actually. And I have a confession to make.
 You see, I might have made the teeeeeniest boo-boo. All very
well-intentioned and noble on my part, of course, but—
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Get to the point, Discord.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: You remember that whole thing with King Sombra? That was slightly my fault. And by "slightly", I mean... I brought him back.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: You did?! But why?!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Which is why I also brought back three other villains who are now on the
 loose and not really big fans of yours. So... my bad.
</dd><dd><b>Mane Six</b> and <b>Spike</b>: [gasp]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: Let me get this straight. You wanted to
boost Twilight's confidence, so you brought back Chrysalis, Cozy Glow,
and Tirek to attack her?!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Don't forget Sombra.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: And while you united these three villains, <i>you</i> pretended to be Grogar?!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Discord, how could you do this to Twilight?! And us?!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Look what a great job you did defeating Sombra. All the confidence you gained. Remember the cheering? The hoof-bumps?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Except it was all a lie.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: A well-intentioned lie.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: For all the time you've spent with us, you really haven't picked up too much in the way of friendship lessons, huh?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You've been setting up challenges for us the whole time, haven't you? None of our successes were actually real.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Of course they were! You just had an extremely good-looking safety net.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: And how was that supposed to help again?
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: I intended to prepare Twilight for anything by orchestrating an epic attack at her coronation.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: You beastly beast! Don't you know how much this
day means to Twilight?! And me?! I made her dress! Why wait until now
for such a horrible plan?!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: You don't take a final exam on your first day of class. Just think – after defeating <i>three</i> baddies, Twilight would have to believe that she's the leader we all know she is!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: You have made a grave misjudgment, Discord. Do you have anything else you'd like to tell us?!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Would you like the good news or the bad news?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: <i>That</i> wasn't the bad news?!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: All my chaos magic is... gone. Trapped in Grogar's Bell.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [sighs] So what's the good news?
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Chrysalis, Tirek, and Cozy Glow now have all of the real Grogar's magic.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: <i><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">in what world is that good news?!</span></i>
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Compared to me losing my powers, anything else <i>is</i> good news!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Twilight, Luna, we need to make a plan. Maybe it's not too late to stop this disaster from happening!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I... I need some time to think first.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Well, there isn't any time! Look what I overheard them saying! [snaps]
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Ugh! Just listen to my voice and use your imagination!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: [in Discord's voice] Let the fool go. Without magic, he's no threat. Besides, we have plans.
</dd><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: [in Discord's voice] The "Lame Six" are so
busy being perfect, they haven't even noticed what we've been up to.
Have I mentioned how great revenge is?
</dd><dd><b>Lord Tirek</b>: [in Discord's voice] I hope you got a name picked out for your future kingdom. Because it's time to destroy Equestria!
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>, <b>Cozy Glow</b>, and <b>Lord Tirek</b>: [laughing evilly in Discord's voice]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Discord</b>: They're probably on their way to attack Canterlot right now!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Then we'll stop 'em!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: How?! Stopping Sombra by himself was hard enough! And that was with lord-of-chaos training wheels!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Twilight, it doesn't matter if Discord set up your successes or not. We believe in you and always have.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: Lean on your strengths to counter your weaknesses.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: My strengths? Right! Spike! Send a letter to Star Swirl! Tell him we need the Pillars to guard the border of Canterlot!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [voiceover] If the villains are coming
for a fight, we'll have one waiting for them! With Chrysalis on the
loose, she'll go after Starlight! Warn Cadance and Shining Armor!
They're our final line of defense if we fail!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The ultimate battle for the fate of Equestria is coming!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: We're not going anywhere until you two stop arguing! Chrysalis, say something nice about Tirek.
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: [groans] He's... red.
</dd><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: Tirek?
</dd><dd><b>Lord Tirek</b>: She's... not as annoying as I expected.
</dd><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: Good! Now we were talking about Grogar's Bell.
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: We should take the magic inside it. You know how powerful Discord was. That much chaos magic in our veins...
</dd><dd><b>Lord Tirek</b>: But taking it all would be madness! It's impossible for any other creature to control!
</dd><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: I guess if you need a guinea pig to find out if anypony can use chaos magic, I'll volunteer.

</dd><dd><b>Cozy Glow</b>: So, where should we strike first?
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: [laughs] Everywhere.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We've faced enemies of Equestria
before. And we've always succeeded, no matter the odds. That wouldn't be
 possible without all of you.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: You're welcome!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Dude, read the room.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: So I ask for your help again today in
what is our biggest battle yet. All of Equestria is at stake, and I
can't do this alone. But I'm not afraid. Because with friendship as our
armor and teamwork as our power, nopony can ever bring us down!
