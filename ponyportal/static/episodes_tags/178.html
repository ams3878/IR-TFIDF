</dd><dd><b>Yona</b>: Huh?
</dd><dd>[whooshing]
</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: Whoa!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Did I miss the Teacher of the Month announcement?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: You're just in time. But it's gonna be me.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, right. I got this one nailed.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And the Friendship School Teacher of the Month is... Fluttershy!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [groans] Again?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Come on!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, my! I don't know how I keep winning.
</dd><dd>[camera flashes]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah. Me, neither.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The award is based on the students' vote. They must really like you.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Congratulations, Fluttershy!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Next item of business – I've been looking into a new activity for our friendship classes. Spike?
</dd><dd>[pages flapping]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Section one-forty-seven, paragraph two
 states that teamwork is a key part of friendship. And section
two-two-nine, paragraph nine says outdoor activity reinforces learning.
Add that together, and what do you get?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ooh, ooh! Okay, let me see. One-forty-seven, two-twenty-nine, carry the two... Three hundred and eighty-seven?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Mm-mm. A teamwork field trip. Leading it is a Teacher of the Month-type job, so I thought I'd ask—
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I'm your pony, Twilight! Sweet Apple Acres has taught me a thing or two about workin' together.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, but being a Wonderbolt's the definition of teamwork.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [chuckles] I'm sure you're not sayin' fancy flyin' makes ya a better choice than me.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [chuckles] I wouldn't say "better". Just a little more qualified. No offense.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Maybe you can lead the field trip together.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [stutters]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [stutters]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Of course! Who better to model the importance of working as a team?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Um, Rarity? Fluttershy? Me? Spike? This flowerpot?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Both of you are teamwork experts. If
the students see the two of you teaching together, they'll learn even
more. I know you've been competitive in the past, but I'm sure you'd
never let that get in the way of friendship education.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Of course!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Totally!

</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: That's what we're doing?! So fun! [grunts]
</dd><dd><b>Sandbar</b>: [chuckles] Pretty sure the headmare has something else in mind.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: All right, class. Today you'll learn how important working together is for building a strong friendship.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hey, y'all! Ready to get out there and do some learnin' the Apple family way?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: This is basically gonna be the best field trip in the history of ever! With me in charge, that is. Whoa!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [chuckles nervously] With <i>us</i> in charge. Meanin' mostly me.

 teamwork! That there's an apple shed. And this here is what we're gonna
 use to build it. Nothin' brings friends together like a little hard
work and honest sweat.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [laughing] Sweat? Seriously? That's supposed to be part of friendship?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Not everypony would know that, Rainbow Dash. Just "Teacher of the Month" kind o' ponies.

</dd><dd><b>Yona</b>: Uh, Yona has questions.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: No time for 'em! Get in the boat!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: You really think winnin' some canoein' record is gonna get you that Teacher of the Month trophy?

</dd><dd><b>Yona</b>: [panicked whistling, coughing] Help! Yak not swim!
</dd><dd>[transformation zap]
</dd><dd><b>Ocellus</b>: That's okay! Your friends can change into creatures that do!
</dd><dd><b>Yona</b>: [panicked whistling, coughing]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: How's the canoeing... going?
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: About as good as the apple shed building.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I totally had things under control until Applejack messed 'em up!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I did not!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Did too!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Did not!
</dd><dd><b>Gallus</b>: Yup. It's been like this all day.
</dd><dd><b>Sandbar</b>: I wouldn't say <i>all</i> day. Just... ninety-nine percent of it.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I can't believe this! You're not teaching teamwork! You're competing with each other! I thought you were past that!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: We are! Mostly.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: We got carried away with wantin' to be the Teacher of the Month is all.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The Teacher of the Month wouldn't care
 about being the Teacher of the Month! I know Fluttershy would be
thrilled to see another pony win. That's it! I'm taking over this field
trip!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: H-Hold up, Twilight. Don't count Rainbow Dash
 for the award just yet. You shoulda seen her fire up those students to
build a shed.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: No way! <i>You're</i> the one the students listen to. Besides, you saved us from those pony-eating fish.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, long story. But Applejack should definitely be Teacher of the Month.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hmmm... Maybe you two have learned something, after all.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Does that mean you'll give us another chance at the Teacher of the— [muffled]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Field trip?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well...
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Come on, Twilight. We get it. No more arguing. Right, Applejack?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Right as rain and twice as fresh!
</dd><dd>[hoof-bump]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Fine. But <i>I'm</i> picking the next activity you two lead. A nature walk. Nopony could possibly argue over that. Right?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b> and <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Right!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: See? We're agreein' already.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, look at that. The path splits up ahead. Left or right?
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: Ugh. Here we go again.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Where to, Rainbow Dash?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I was thinking right... unless you want to go left. Because what makes <i>you</i> happy makes <i>me</i> happy.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Aw, heck. Forget about me. You want to go right, we'll go right.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: But teamwork means listening to other ponies, so it's up to you.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, aren't you as sweet as sugar apple pie? But it's up to <i>you</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Yona</b>: Ugh! Follow me! Yak know best way!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hey! Where are y'all goin'?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[montage music]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ocellus</b>: I think we've gone in the same circle five times.
</dd><dd><b>Sandbar</b>: Only because <i>someponies</i> won't make up their minds about which way to go.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Do you want to keep going in a circle, Applejack?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Up to you, Rainbow Dash. I insist.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [chuckles] No, no. <i>I</i> insist.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Heh. But <i>I</i> insisted first.
</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: Are we still on a field trip? 'Cause this just feels like being lost.
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: Ugh.
</dd><dd>[whoosh]
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: We can still get back to school before dark if we cross that ravine and stop doubling back.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: We knew that. All part of our plan. Right, Applejack?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh, yup! All we have to do is, uh... build a
bridge 'cross that, uh, giant canyon, and we're home free. That is,
if-if you think a bridge is a good idea.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Only if <i>you</i> want to build a bridge.
</dd><dd><b>Gallus</b>: <i>Stop!</i> Listen. We can just fly everyone over and be done.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Nope! There's still plenty o' time to teach y'all a lesson in teamwork.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Cooperation!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Togetherness!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You are so right!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Only as right as you are!
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: <i>Okay!</i> We'll build a bridge! What do we use?

</dd><dd><b>Sandbar</b>: It took us a while to get it.
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: Especially at the ravine. It would've been so much easier to just fly home.
</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: But instead, our professors built bridges the wrong way just to show us how important teamwork is.
</dd><dd><b>Gallus</b>: Yeah. That was super dangerous. Talk about commitment.
</dd><dd><b>Ocellus</b>: We know it's too early to pick the Teacher of the Month. But we'd like you to consider Rainbow Dash and Applejack.

another one right away.
