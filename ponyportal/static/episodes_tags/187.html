</dd><dd><b>Mane Six except Pinkie Pie</b>: [scream, groan]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: What is that thing?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's called a yovidaphone. It's from Yakyakistan, where it's actually quite popular.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Is it supposed to sound like that?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Not exactly. It's known to produce a fairly complicated, melodically rich, and harmonious tone.

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [panting] Phew! And that's with only a few days of practice! Can you believe it?!
</dd><dd>[honk!]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Yes. Yes, I can.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I can honestly say I've never heard anything like it in my life.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Well, if you enjoyed listening to my playing
 half as I enjoyed playing my playing, then I should totally play more!
That way, we'll be even!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, I don't think that's necessary, Pinkie.
</dd><dd><b>Rest of the Mane Six</b>: [agreeing]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Please. Don't.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: There's a chance I may have missed a note or two here or there, but I just love playing so much! [sighs] You complete me.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, I, for one, am glad you're having so much fun with your new hobby.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [not listening] Uh-huh. Sure.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And it's great that you're learning a
new skill, and... and you're just waiting for me to finish talking so
you can start playing again, aren't ya?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No! But if you're done... And a-one, and a-two, and a-I know what to do! [inhales deeply]
</dd><dd>[dissonant music resumes]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [sighs, to Angel Bunny] It's okay. She's gone.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Anypony else think that sounded like an apple core cut up in a pulp grinder?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Apple-solutely! Uh, absolutely.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Okay, so maybe she isn't good yet. But she's our friend, and we should be supportive.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: She just started playin'. She's <i>bound</i> to get better. Right?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, we just need to be supportive of her practicing... [groans] So the getting-better part happens as fast as possible.

</dd><dd>[screech]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [burbles, sighs] We need to do somethin' about Pinkie Pie's playin'!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Like, now!

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Is it really that bad?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Does <i>this</i> answer your question?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Uh, a trophy?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: For second place. Second! Place! All because of Pinkie's playing!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: And I wanted to turn heads with my new fall line, but not like this! [sobbing]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: And thanks to her fruit-blastin' melodies, I got an orchard full of nothin' but applesauce! And it ain't even saucin' season!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: And just look what her playing did to poor Fluttershy!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [snores, gasps] Oh. So very tired. [yawning]
 It practically took me all night to get the nursery back to sleep.
[resumes snoring]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I mean, I know we said we should all be supportive, but Pinkie's been playin' for moons now, and she's not gettin' any better.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah! If anything, she's gotten worse!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Okay, maybe we can just pretend she's really good, and then I'll find a spell that will—
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Oh, no, no, no! We're not goin' through that
again! Remember how well it worked out when you weren't honest with
Celestia about her actin' ability?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [groans] You're right. We'll just have to tell Pinkie Pie she's not very good at the yovidaphone.

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Phew! Huh, that's weird. I coulda sworn this
 place was packed a second ago. Hey, guys! Can I favor you all with a
tune? I take requests!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Actually, we <i>do</i> have a request, and yeah, it involves your yovidaphone.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You mean the thing I love more than anything
 else in Equestria? My sun, my moon, my stars, my everything? Ooh! Tell
me, tell me, tell me!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: All right. In all honesty... Uh, in all honesty... Rarity has somethin' to say!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Pinkie, please listen to Rainbow Dash.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ugh, fine! So, Pinkie, remember when we all were shocked to discover Princess Celestia wasn't so good at acting?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yeah, she was awful! But that's kind of a random thing to bring up. I thought you wanted to talk about my yovidaphone playing.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, it's, uh... It's just... You need to know, uh... Twilight?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sighs] Pinkie, we all support you,
but we're afraid you're just not good at the yovidaphone, and none of us
 want you to waste your time on something you can't do well.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh. [upbeat] Why didn't you just say so?
</dd><dd>[air deflating]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sighs] We were all really nervous to tell you.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Why? It's just a silly instrument. Well,
lunch break's over. Gotta get back to the bakery. Those apple turnovers
aren't gonna apple themselves! [whistles gleefully] No more yovidaphone
playing for me-e-e!

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sighs] Another beautiful day in Ponyville.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Uh, Twilight, when was the last time you saw Pinkie Pie?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hmmm, not since we told her to stop playing the yovidaphone. I'm still surprised with how well she took it.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I don't think she took it as well as you think she took it.
</dd><dd><b>Daisy</b>: Top of the morning to ya!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Is it morning? I hadn't noticed.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That's not good.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: <i>There</i> you are! We've been looking all over for you!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: It turns out Pinkie may not have taken our critique of her yovidaphone playing in the spirit with which it was intended.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I saw.
</dd><dd>[shriveling]
</dd><dd>[shade closing]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: There's gotta be something we can do.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm sure there is, Spike. We just have to figure out what.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sighs] I don't get it. So she's no good at playing the yovidaphone. What's the big deal? There are <i>so</i> many other things she's really good at doing.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Yeah! Not bein' able to play the yovidaphone is nothin' compared to all the things she <i>can</i> do well.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And that's exactly what we'll show her! I bet if we get her to do the stuff she likes <i>and</i> is good at doing, she'll cheer right back up and forget all about the yovidaphone.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hoo-whee! That's a great idea!
</dd><dd>[air squeaks, hisses]

</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [sighs] My party cannon idea was a real dud.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Don't blame yourself. None of us did any better.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, not to worry. I came up with the
 perfect solution. Instead of trying to remind her what she's good at,
we'll remind her what she's <i>best</i> at. And that's being our friend. We're gonna throw her a Pinkie Pie Appreciation Party!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: That's a wonderful idea! If anypony needs to know how much she's appreciated, it's Pinkie Pie.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: We can get the whole town involved, just so she can see what a good friend she is to everypony.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Then I hereby officially declare today Pinkie Pie Appreciation Day!

</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, for goodness' sakes! Maud. All of your sister's things are gone. Explain.
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] No, they're not. They're right here.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Have you seen Pinkie Pie?
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: Lots of times. I grew up with her.
</dd><dd>[cart rumbling]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Okay, let's try this a different way. Why did you pack up all of Pinkie's things?
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] She asked me to.
</dd><dd><b>Rest of the Mane Six</b>: What?!
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] Pinkie told me to pack up her room and take everything to the rock farm.
</dd><dd><b>Rest of the Mane Six</b>: <i>What?!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] She said she wouldn't need them since she's moving to Yakyakistan.
</dd><dd><b>Rest of the Mane Six</b>: <i><b>What?!</b></i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Terribly sorry, Maud. Must've misheard you. It almost sounded like you said Pinkie's [chuckling] moved to Yakyakistan!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh, Rarity? She <i>did</i> say that.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Uh, terribly sorry, Applejack. Must've misheard you. It almost sounded like you said [chuckling] she did say that!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Maud, I don't understand. Why would Pinkie leave Ponyville?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah! Why would she want to go live with the yaks?
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] She said without the yovidaphone,
her life had no meaning, and at least in Yakyakistan, she could listen
to the masters play. She hoped that would give her some semblance of
happiness.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no! That will not do!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I say we go to Yakyakistan right now and make her come back home!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We can't just march up there and tell Pinkie what to do.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [tearing up] But... we didn't even get a chance to say goodbye!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, we may not be able to go to
Yakyakistan and force her to come home, but we could go say goodbye...
and if we happen to mention how much her friendship means to us, and how
 much we'd miss her if she were gone forever, and then she decided to
come back home on her own...
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Then what are we waiting around here for?! Let's get going to Yakyakistan!

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The music of the yovidaphone.

</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh, uh, sorry!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [despondent] I feel nothing.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Maybe we can help with that.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [despondent] Oh. Hey. What are you guys doing here?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Just hear us out.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: We respect your decision to move to Yakyakistan.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But we just wanted to remind you how much you mean to us, and how much we'd miss you if you decided to move here for—
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [despondent] Fine. I'll move back to Ponyville.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Wow. That was a lot easier than I thought. We're awesome!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie, what's wrong?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [despondent] <i>That's</i> what's wrong. I thought coming here and listening to <i>real</i> yovidaphone playing would make me happy.
</dd><dd>[yaks applauding]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [despondent] It makes me feel worse. I'm <i>never</i> gonna sound like that.
</dd><dd><b>Yigrid</b>: Yovidaphone fan pony watch instrument while Yigrid visit little yak's room?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [despondent] Eh. If I can't play it, I might as well do menial chores for those who can.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Okay, so Pinkie Pie is obviously still miserable.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, I can't bear to see her like this.
</dd><dd>[yovidaphone honks]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Indeed. But what else can we do?
</dd><dd>[yovidaphone honks]

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [stifled giggling] Whoops! Sorry!
</dd><dd>[yovidaphone honking]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I forgot what an awful yovidaphoner I am.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Playing it makes you so happy.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [wistfully] [sighs] It sure does. I mean... it did.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Then you should never stop.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: So say we all!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b> and <b>Rainbow Dash</b>, under: [sounds of agreement]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Absolutely.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: But... you were the ones who told me to stop because I wasn't good.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And we were wrong.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Playing makes you happy.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: And as long as it makes you happy, it doesn't matter how good you are!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: So get up there and show these yaks how it's done!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [stage whisper] I don't know if you've
noticed, but the audience are all yaks, and they kind of have "issues"
with things that aren't perfect! Like my playing!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Pinkie Pie, you get up on that stage and play. If these yaks don't like it, they'll have to answer to us!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Well, okay... If you all say so...
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [clears throat] Ladies and gentleyaks!
Performing for her very first time here, let's give a big round of

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You think so? Even though it wasn't perfect?
</dd><dd><b>Yigrid</b>: Yovidaphone is instrument of happiness. Playing yovidaphone make pony happy. Pony playing <i>is</i> perfect!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Well if <i>that's</i> the case, lemme play
