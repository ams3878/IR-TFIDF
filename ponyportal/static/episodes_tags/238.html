</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Starswirled Music Festival, we have arrived!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Two days and nights of cool music, hot food, and sleepin' under the stars!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: To Pinkie and me, this festival is about one thing only.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b> and <b>Pinkie Pie</b>: PostCrush!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [chuckles] We know. Y'all won't stop talkin' about it.&nbsp;
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Who, PostCrush? That's only because PostCrush is the craziest, most amazing-est pop duo ever! PostCrush, PostCrush, <i>PostCrush!</i>
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh. I see your point.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: After they cancelled their last tour to go on "indefinite hiatus", we thought we'd never see them live.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: But we thought wrong! Roll call!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Kiwi Lollipop...
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: A.K.A. "K-Lo"!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: ...is the cool one.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: While Supernova Zap...
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: A.K.A. "Su-Z"!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: ...is the zany one! Not unlike another certain dynamic duo I know.
</dd><dd><b>Rest of Equestria Girls</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: All right, less laughin' and more gaffin'. We got an early mornin' tomorrow.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [giggles]

<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Starswirled day one! Come and get it!
</dd><dd>[whack!]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Hey!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh! Uh, sorry. I'll be more careful from now on.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Ah. Not gonna let a little thing like intense pain ruin this perfect day!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: So, I says to Big Mac, "Get your own chicken coop!"
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [spit take, laughs]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hey!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Sorry.&nbsp;That one has animals in it.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: What do you call a PostCrush fan with three eyes? Pinkie Pie!

</dd><dd>[splat!]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Whoa!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Whoa! Are you okay?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Just a little mud.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Sunset, Sunset! Look!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Whoa!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: So many lines to stand in! This day's
already amazing! Let's go! [to "Cherry Crash"] You come to this line
often? Any other sweet lines we should hit up?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hey!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Hmm. That line's moving fast. Huh. They are, too.&nbsp;Can't this thing move any faster?!
</dd><dd><b>Security Guard</b>: Security is an art. It cannot be rushed.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [sighs]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Aw, cheer up. Lines fly when you're having fun!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[beeping]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: See you in there, Sunset!
</dd><dd>[beeping]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Whew.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Welp, y'all have fun seein' PostCrush. We'll see ya back at camp tonight.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Main objective – Get front row for
PostCrush. Mission procedure – we cut around the neon garden to the main
 stage and rush the front during Pon Iver's set. We can camp there until
 showtime.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Secondary objective – win a tandem bicycle!
</dd><dd>[zip!]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: All I have to do is guess how many candies are in the jar. And my sugar senses say... three hundred and five!
</dd><dd>[buzzer]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Awww.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: What about seeing PostCrush together?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Uh, this bike has two seats, Sunset. That's one more than usual! Fine. I'll focus. Oh, look! The neon garden!
</dd><dd>[zip!]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [groans]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Whee! [giggling]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [panting]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [giggling, snorts]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [panting] The neon garden is a maze?!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [giggling]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [groans] Where is Pinkie Pie?!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Come on! We're gonna miss the show!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Awww.
</dd><dd><b>Festival Artist</b>: Who wants to be part of an art show?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! I do! I do!
</dd><dd>[splat!]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [giggles] Guess what! I spilled paint, and it looks exactly like Rarity with a pirate mustache!
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: What? It's washable.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: There. Now, no more getting separated and no more distractions.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You got it, Su— Whoa!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: They are about to go on! We'll have to push to the front row! Come on!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [sniffs, gasps] Puffed Pastry's exclusive
star-crusted, cinnamon-dipped churros! No! I will not give in! [squeals]
 I can't resist!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: This is the worst possible time for churros, Pinkie! W-Whoa!
</dd><dd>[crash!]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [laughs] Our bad.

<dl><dd><b>Rest of Equestria Girls</b>: [chattering]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: There they are! Two peas in the pod! How was it? Rad-tacular? Amaze-magic?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [groans]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh, what's wrong?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: We missed PostCrush. Someone wanted to
win a bike, then got us lost in a maze, covered in paint, sidelined by
churros, and finally, kicked out!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uhhh...
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I'm really sorry. I wish we could do the day all over again. I'd do it different.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Me, too. I'd do it alone.

</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Starswirled... day one?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: ..."Get your own chicken coop!"
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [spit take, laughs] Sorry.&nbsp;That one has animals in it.

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Sunset, Sunset! Look! So many lines to stand in! This day's already amazing!
</dd><dd>[zip!]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Are you okay?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I'm... not sure.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You come to this line often? Any other sweet lines we should hit up?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: What's going on?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You said it, Sunset. [to Security Guard] What's with these long lines, man?
</dd><dd><b>Security Guard</b>: Security is an art.
</dd><dd><b>Security Guard</b> and <b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: It can't be rushed.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Welp, y'all have fun seein' PostCrush. We'll see ya back at camp tonight.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: What do you want to do first, Sunset?
There's so much we can do! Like... win a tandem bicycle?! All I have to
do is guess how many candies are in the jar.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Anyone else having serious deja vu?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Nope. Just deja V-you. [laughs] Get it? 'Cause it's just you? With the deja v...
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I don't know how to explain it, but... I did all of this yesterday.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We were at school yesterday. [grunts]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Pinkie Pie? I know where she's headed.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: What are we waiting for?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Pinkie, focus. If you keep running off like this, we'll be late for the concert!
</dd><dd><b>Festival Artist</b>: Who wants to be part of an art show?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ooh, ooh, ooh! I do! I do!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: No!
</dd><dd>[splat!]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [laughs]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [growls]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Awesome.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [groans] If this already happened, could you've warned us about the paint?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [laughs]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Pinkie Pie's just splattered paint, and it looks exactly like Rarity with a pirate mustache. How's that?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, that would prove it for sure!
</dd><dd>[stall door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Seriously?!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: What? It's washable.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: So, what do you think, Twi? Any scientific explanation for this?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's possible that yesterday, a snag
in the fabric of spacetime could cause a temporal point – i.e., today –
to fold in on itself and thereby repeat. Quite facinating, really.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Time loop!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Time loop! [laughs] Classic Sunset.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: But why only me? The only time I was alone was on the hill when I wished—
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: For more wishes? Solid choice.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: This might sound crazy, but... I think Equestrian magic is giving me another chance to see PostCrush.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Eh. Not that crazy.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Eh. Seen crazier. Wait. Why didn't you see PostCrush?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Mistakes were made.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Aw, don't beat yourself up. I promise we'll
see them together tonight, or so help me, I— [sniffs] What's that smell?
 [sniffs] Could it be? [gasps] Puffed Pastry's exclusive star-crusted,
cinnamon-dipped churros! Now's proooob'ly not the best time to go get
one.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: It's not. Let's get moving so nothing goes wrong for PostCrush.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: On the other hand, if I get two, then Sunset
 can have one with me. No! No! I will not give in! [slurps, whimpers,
groans] But I can't resist!
</dd><dd>[zip!]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Okay, <i>this</i> is the worst possible time for churros! Pinkie, stop!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Whoa!
</dd><dd>[crash!]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b> and <b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [groaning]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [laughs] Our bad.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: No, <i>her</i> bad. You saw whose bad it was, right, sir?

</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oops! Heh. Sorry. I'll be more careful from now on.

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: What do you call a PostCrush fan with three eyes? Pinkie Pie—!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: No time for jokes. I'm gonna head out on my own today. Laters!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You okay?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Keep Pinkie Pie busy! Thanks!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: But weren't you supposed to see PostCrush togeter?

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hah. There she is. The lone wolf. [howls]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [sighs]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Pinkie Pie's been actin' mighty strange this evening. Any idea what might've happened to her?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: We... lost track of each other.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Me lose track of Sunset? Hah! But she's been
 right here the whole time! Right, actual Sunset Shimmer? [imitating
Sunset Shimmer] Right, Pinkie Pie! By the way, your roasting technique
is flawless! [laughs, normally] Thanks!
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [sarcastically] How was the show?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: It was... perfect.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [scoffs] I was being judgmental, darling. What is the point of throwing shade if no one's there to catch it?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Sorry. Too blissed out from the show to care right now. Talk tomorrow?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [snoring]
</dd><dd>[phone buzzes, alarm sounds]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Hmm? [sighs]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: It... can't be. It's still—
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Starswirled day one! Come and get it!
</dd><dd>[whack!]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh! Uh, sorry. I'll be more careful from now on.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Okay, Equestrian magic.

</dd><dd><b>Snips</b>: You stage direct— Whoa! [groans]
</dd><dd>[splat!]
</dd><dd><b>Snips</b>: Aww. Could've warned me, you know?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Tried that. You called me a witch.
</dd><dd><b>Snips</b>: [gasps] Are you?!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [groans, grunts]
</dd><dd><b>Festival Artist</b>: Hey, watch it!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Sorry. Thought you didn't come up 'til
later. I'll make a note of that for next time. Day seventeen – saw paint
 guy by food truck right before he breaks up with his girlfriend. It's
not you, it's her. I'm not a witch. I'm just gonna go.
</dd><dd><b>Festival Artist</b>: Yeah, well... you better run!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Run from my problems? I... actually haven't tried that yet.

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [yelps] Sunset! Slow down!
</dd><dd><b>Equestria Girls</b>: [yelping]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I gotta break out of here somehow! Maybe if I leave the campgrounds, it'll finally end!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: What. Are. You. Talking about?!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: This is all <i>your</i> fault!

<dl><dd>[metal creaks]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Are you saying the calendar industry cooked up a conspiracy to make every day today just to save paper?!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: No, I'm not saying that at all.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You're right. It's too obvious.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Sorry to hijack the RV while you were all sleeping, but I've tried everything except leaving.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hmm... It's possible a snag in the fabric of spacetime could cause a...
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b> and <b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: ...temporal point – i.e., this day – to fold in on itself and thereby repeat.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b> and <b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: You really have done this a lot.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b> and <b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Okay, you've made your point! Stop!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [sighs] This time loop started because I missed PostCrush. So why didn't it end when I saw them?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You sure it's only about PostCrush?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Uh...
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I probably ask you this every day, but what did Princess Twilight say when you told her about this?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: The journal! Of course! How did I not try that weeks ago?
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [giggles] Seriously though, why <i>didn't</i>
 you? Are you asking yourself, "Self, how do you spend seventeen days
with my best friend Pinkie Pie without asking for help until now?"
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Uh...
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Still think this is only about PostCrush?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Bad news. Transmission's shot. Repairs ain't gonna be cheap. Tow truck says he'll need cash tomorrow.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [yawns]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [sighs, sarcastically] Tomorrow? Sure. Tell him I'll give him a million bucks if I see him!
</dd></dl>

</dd><dd>[phone buzzes, alarm sounds]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Huh?

</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [groans]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Starswirled day one! Come and get it!
</dd><dd>[whack!]
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Ow.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oops! Heh. Sorry. I'll be more careful from now on.
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: No, Rainbow Dash. You won't! Every day you say that, but you never are! Why won't you change?!
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Okaaaaay...
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: What do you call a PostCrush fan with three eyes? Pinkie Pie!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: So you think Princess Twilight can help you with this temporal loop thingy?
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: [sighs] I sure hope so.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [slurping]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[buzzing]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: Sunset, I've been doing some research, and it looks like you've found another long lost Equestrian artifact.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Lucky me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Princess Twilight Sparkle</b>: The Time Twirler. I don't know
 how it found its way into your world, but when activated, it has the
power to loop time. What you're experiencing isn't simply magic run amok
 or a wish gone awry. Somepony is using the Time Twirler to cause this.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: If we find whoever used the Time Twirler to <i>start</i> the loop, we'll be able to <i>end</i> it for good. Tell the others we've got a new mission.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That was just a little preview of the rad-tacular... [continues under]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Whoever has the Time Twirler is the only
person besides you who isn't in the same place doing the same thing
every day. Have you noticed anyone who doesn't belong? Anyone out of
place? Anyone... evil?!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I don't think so. How could I? Every day is the same!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>[Lyra and Bon Bon]</b>
<dl><dd>Every day's the same
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: It goes round and round. Wait. What was that?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>[Festival Artist]</b>
<dl><dd>Round and round and round and round
</dd><dd>Round and round and–
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Hey, what are you listening to?
</dd><dd><b>Festival Artist</b>: Meh.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>[The Dazzlings]</b>
<dl><dd>So ordinary, stuck on repeat
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: I think we've got a clue.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>[The Dazzlings]</b>
<dl><dd>Gotta find the passion, passion, passion
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Equestria Girls</b>: [gasp]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: They must be a last-minute addition!
</dd><dd><b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Who?

</dd><dd><b>Adagio Dazzle</b>: That's about being stuck in this miserable human world with no magic or hope of returning to Equestria.
