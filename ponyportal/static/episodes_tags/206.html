<dl><dd><b>Trixie</b>: I know how hard you've been working lately, so I figured you could use a break.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [gasps] Trixie, this looks amazing! But my job doesn't really seem like work.

</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Sure, being counselor for the students at Twilight's School of Friendship is demanding, but—

</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What was I saying? Oh, right. Being
able to use the experiences of my checkered past and help young students
 feels pretty great. Oh, yum! [chomps] Mmm, thanks!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Of course I feel nothing but admiration for the
work you do, but it is a little all-consuming. And I miss spending time
with you.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What are you talking about? We're spending time right now.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Well...
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [chewing]

</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [sighs] Sorry. I cast a spell on the
door to my office so this bracelet goes off whenever there's a knock.
Yona is having the worst time with her braids lately. [sips] Anyway, you
 were saying?

<dl><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: I totally respect my younger cousins'
decisions to stay seaponies, but they've never been on dry land.
Preparing for a visit with them is almost as much work as the research
assignment Headmare Twilight gave me on hazardous fauna of the Everfree
Forest! How would <i>you</i> describe a shower to creatures who live in water? So far, I've got "warm" and "steamy". Actually, steam has water in it.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Silverstream, there are a lot of students who want to see me today.
</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: I just need a few shower adjectives... that don't rely on the wet part.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [sighs] Well, there's "clean", "relaxing", um...
</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: "Relaxing"... I don't know. A nap's relaxing, too. "Warm" and "clean" are okay. Wow. I have to give this some more thought.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Oh. Okay. Well, I'm here to help. My door is always open.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Except for today, of course.
</dd><dd>[door closes]
</dd><dd><b>Student Pony</b>: [whimpers]
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: If we leave now, we can finish everything before sundown.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Trixie, I-I can't leave. It's almost
spring break. Twilight and the others have already left to celebrate the
 spring solstice in Canterlot, and I have to help the students with any
issues before <i>they</i> head home for the holiday.

</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Sunburst is coming to town?

<dl><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Nopony is saying your job isn't important, but plans you make with your friends are important, too.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [sighs] I know. I'm sorry. I
shouldn't have forgotten. Obviously I need to be available to my
students, but that doesn't mean I can't help with all the things we have
 to do.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Good!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Great!
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: So... what <i>are</i> all the things we have to do?
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: [whines] Maud needs streamers for the
decorations. Sunburst wants us to pick up a genuine pre-Equestrian
spring solstice chafing dish from the antique shop.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Of course he does.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Mudbriar wants a bouquet of flowering sticks – whatever that means. And I thought we were <i>both</i> looking forward to Mrs. Cake teaching us the secret recipe to her famous spring solstice cake.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Oh! I-I totally am! [chuckles] But we could just buy a cake from her, right?
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: We could... but then we'd miss out on baking <i>together</i>. Plus, the time I spent flattering and convincing and begging her to share the recipe with you for nothing! And we promised to <i>make</i> a cake, not <i>buy</i> a cake! And the Great and Powerful Trixie <i>keeps her promises!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Okay! Why don't we just split up these jobs? I'll get the streamers and the chafing dish. You—
</dd><dd>[bracelet chiming]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: —get started on those sticks, and
I'll be right back! [laughs nervously] You know, why don't I just hang
on to this? Don't want to forget the things I just said I'd take care
of. Because I am totally gonna take care of them!

</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Whoops! Heh. Sorry, Rose. But I need a bouquet of flowering sticks, stat!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: I thought <i>I</i> was getting the flowering sticks.
</dd><dd><b>Rose</b>: Uh, I'm still not exactly sure what they are.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: No one is.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Right. Got it. You get the sticks. I'll get the streamers—

</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What? No! Aww! The Great and Powerful
 Trixie might keep her promises, but the Busy and Distracted Starlight
sure doesn't. I promised to help her today, and I haven't done a single
thing.
</dd><dd><b>Mrs. Cake</b>: Oh, that doesn't sound hard, dear. A-And I'm not quite sure how to tell you this, but [whispering] your hoof is glowing.

</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: Starlight, you have a minute?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Actually, Silverstream, I don't. Besides, I need to lock up the school for the holiday, and it's time <i>you</i>
 caught the train home. I'm sure a smart and capable student like you
can figure out the solution to any problem over the break. But for now,
the counselor's office is closed.

</dd><dd><b>Mudbriar</b>: Technically, it's not symmetrical or aesthetically pleasing.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: [growls]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Maybe it's not the best cake. But we made it together, and that's what counts.
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] I'm glad you brought it. And everything else. I'm very excited. This is going to be the most perfect party ever.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: And with all of your students home for the
holiday, I won't have to worry about you being summoned to your office
in the middle of it.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Mm-hmm. Nothing is gonna take me away from this party.
</dd><dd><b>Terramar</b>: Hello?! Starlight?!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [spits]
</dd><dd><b>Terramar</b>: Starlight?!
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] Sorry. This is a private cavern.
</dd><dd><b>Terramar</b>: Is Starlight here?! I was told she'd be here!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What's wrong?
</dd><dd><b>Terramar</b>: I'm Terramar, Silverstream's brother. I've been looking all over for you. Silverstream is missing!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: [chewing]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I don't understand. Silverstream didn't come home?
</dd><dd><b>Terramar</b>: Mm-mm. I was supposed to meet her at the Mount Aris train station, but she never showed up!
</dd><dd><b>Sunburst</b>: It's a long way between Ponyville and Mount Aris. She could be anywhere.
</dd><dd><b>Terramar</b>: Our parents are leading teams of Hippogriffs
and seaponies, searching the land and sea between here and our home.
They sent me to check the school.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: But the school's closed. All the students are gone.
</dd><dd><b>Terramar</b>: Are you sure? I know she had a big project due for Twilight. Do you think she might've stayed to finish it?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: She never told me about a project.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Well, to be fair, you closed your office the last time she came by.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Really?
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: [short laugh]
</dd><dd><b>Terramar</b>: What kind of counselor turns away a student with a problem?!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: The kind with too much on her plate! Starlight has always gone out of her way for her students. And I mean <i>always</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Except apparently when it matters.
This is all my fault! You all go back to the party. Terramar and I will
check the school. We'll find your sister.
</dd><dd>[teleportation zap]
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] I should've known it couldn't last. Party perfection is more of a Pinkie thing.

</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: A cockatrice?
</dd><dd><b>Terramar</b>: Could that be what her project was on? You
don't think she went into the Everfree Forest to find a cockatrice by
herself, do you?

</dd><dd><b>Mudbriar</b>: Technically, she wasn't alone.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Mudbriar</b>: But we wanted to help anyway.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Thanks. All of you. But the students are <i>my</i> responsibility. I'm the one who didn't do my job when it actually mattered.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: I... might share a bit of the blame for pressuring you into leaving work early.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: But I don't want to ruin your party.
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] We can still have a party. A search party.
</dd><dd><b>Terramar</b>: Can we talk about all this later? Silverstream might be in the Everfree Forest alone!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b> and <b>Sunburst</b>: [gasp]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: We think she went in to do research on cockatrices.
</dd><dd><b>Sunburst</b>: What?! The gaze of the cockatrice is known to petrify any who dare to cross its path! <i>And</i> the reptilian birds are elusive and solitary! W-Where would we even start?!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: I have a lot of experience telling ponies that I have experience with the dangerous creatures of Everfree Forest! Follow me!

</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Trixie, do you have any idea how to find a cockatrice?
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: No. But usually, when there's a dangerous creature in the forest I don't want to meet, this is how I meet them.
</dd><dd><b>Sunburst</b>: We might need a more concrete plan.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Hmph. Suit yourself.
</dd><dd><b>Terramar</b>: Um, according to Silverstream's research, the cockatrice prefers rocky terrain and ample shade.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Rocks and shade. Hmm. I can't imagine where we'll find <i>that</i> in a forest.
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] Actually, rocks aren't the most hospitable environment for shade trees.
</dd><dd><b>Mudbriar</b>: Technically, pine trees like Pinus cembra or Pinus sylvestris <i>can</i> grow from narrow crevasses or cracks in a rocky rhizosphere.
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] You complete me.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: There's some pine trees over there!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[cockatrices clucking and hissing]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [whispering] I thought you said they were solitary!
</dd><dd><b>Sunburst</b>: [whispering] They are! This must be some kind of migration.
</dd><dd><b>Terramar</b>: [whimpers] At least there's no sign of Silverstream. I can't imagine getting caught in the middle of that flock.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: [whispering] It's just lucky we're all over here and they're all over there.
</dd><dd>[cockatrice hisses]
</dd><dd><b>Mudbriar</b>: Technically—
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: [whispering] Don't even say it!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Whatever you do, don't look at them. Their gaze can turn you to stone.
</dd><dd><b>Terramar</b>: [whispering] So what do we do?

</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Now what?!
</dd><dd><b>Sunburst</b>: Let's hope Silverstream found a good place to
hide. There could be hundreds more cockatrices on the way. If this
really is a migration, it'll take a full lunar cycle to complete.
</dd><dd><b>Terramar</b>: Ohhh. I have to get word back to our parents that Silverstream could be surrounded by those terrifying birds!
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] And as handsome as Mudbriar is now, we should probably catch one of them to turn him back to normal.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [groans] This <i>is</i> all my fault. I'm never taking time off from my counseling duties again.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: That seems a little extreme.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Really?! If I hadn't galloped off to a
 holiday celebration, Silverstream would be safe with her family, and
you'd all be enjoying Maud's party! Instead, my student is missing,
we're surrounded by a flock of petrifying chicken-snakes, <i>and</i> Maud's boyfriend was turned into a hunk of rock!
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] You got the "hunk" part right.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: And to top it off, we have no idea if Silverstream even came to Everfree at all! But I have no idea where else to look!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Has that always been there?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What? Oh, that's the students'
treehouse. Apparently it grew from the Tree of Harmony and— [gasps] Of
course! That should've been the first place we looked!
</dd><dd>[scraping]

</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [sighs, gasps] Silverstream, look out!
</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: Counselor Starlight, no!

</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: Wait!
</dd><dd>[magic humming]
</dd><dd><b>Edith</b>: [clucking softly]
</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: This is Edith. She's helping me with my project.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I... don't understand.
</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: After you encouraged me to solve my own
problem, I decided to get my project done before I left. That way, I
could really focus on my family during my visit. The school was closed,
so I came here.
</dd><dd><b>Terramar</b>: Why didn't you tell anyone? Mom and Dad are worried sick!
</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: Oh, no! I'm so sorry! Once Edith
volunteered to help, I guess I lost track of time. Cockatrices are
really friendly if you know how to interact with them.
</dd><dd><b>Edith</b>: [clucking softly]
</dd><dd><b>Sunburst</b>: I can't believe you figured out how to trigger her nesting response.
</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: They are really fascinating creatures. Did
 you know that they migrate to the Everfree Forest once a year? Can you
imagine what would happen if you stumble on a whole flock of these?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I have a few ideas.
</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: [gasps]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: I'm sorry you got turned to stone looking for me. But I'm glad Edith was able to turn you back.
</dd><dd><b>Sunburst</b>: [hushed, to Trixie] How do you tell the difference?
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] I have mixed feelings about it.
</dd><dd><b>Mudbriar</b>: Technically, I will always be a stick pony.
But the experience has given me an even deeper appreciation for the
density and permanence of rock.
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] Swoon.
</dd><dd><b>Terramar</b>: Silverstream and I should get going. But I wanted to thank you for everything you did to help find her.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I just wish I hadn't abandoned her in the first place.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Starlight, you didn't abandon her.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I might as well have. Even though it turned out all right, things could've been a lot worse.
</dd><dd><b>Sunburst</b>: You can't be expected to supervise your students every second of every day.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I'm not so sure.
</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: I like that you're always available, but it kind of makes it okay to come to you with stuff that maybe isn't super important.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Of course being a school counselor is a big responsibility. But always being at work isn't fair to anypony. Especially me.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Do you think if I had set times to see me, it might help you decide what you <i>really</i> need to talk about?
</dd><dd><b>Silverstream</b>: To be honest, you really weren't very helpful with the other stuff anyway.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Yeah— Wait, what?!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Happy Spring Solst-astic, everypony! Who wants a piece of Mrs. Cake's famous—?
</dd><dd>[clang!]
