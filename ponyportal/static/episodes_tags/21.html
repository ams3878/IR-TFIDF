to himself, "Hmm. My favorite little tree isn't such a little tree
anymore." So she sang her song, big and strong, and they all lived in
that great, big tree happily ever after. The... end.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Applejack! Were you reading a bedtime story to... an apple tree?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Heh... uh... Well, ya know, bein' replanted
in a whole new place is very upsettin' for a tree... and Bloomberg here
is one of my favorites.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: No fair, Applejack! You've got a luxurious, private sleeper car for a <i>tree</i>, while I am crowded and cramped in the same car with all the other ponies. How am I supposed to get my beauty sleep?!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: But Bloomberg's the whole reason we're makin'
 this trip. He needs his rest so we can give him as a gift to my
relatives in Appleloosa.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Hmph! You talk about it as if it's your baby or something.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Who you callin' a baby?! Bloomberg's no baby!
 Don't wet widdle Rarity make you all saddy-waddy. Bloomberg's a big and
 strong apple tree. Yes, he is. A-coochie-coochie-coo-coo-coo!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: It's widdle Rarity who's all "saddy-waddy"! Urgh!

</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, speaking of, some of these popcorn kernels didn't get popped.

</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ghk...
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Good night!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Uhh... maybe it's time we all got a little shut-eye. We've got a big day ahead of us tomorrow.

</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [whispering] If I was sleeping, how could I have asked you if you were asleep?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [whispering] Oh yeah! [giggle]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [whispering] When we get to Appleloosa,
you think we'll have to carry that heavy tree all the way from the train
 to the orchard?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [whispering] What tree? You mean Bloomberg?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [whispering and sarcastically] ...No, Fluttershy.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [whispering] Fluttershy's not a tree, silly!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What's going on?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Rainbow Dash thinks Fluttershy's a tree!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [whispering] I do <i>not</i> think she's a tree! I was just–
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Did you <i>say</i> she was a tree?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [whispering] No. Well.. Yes. But not exactly–

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: She's not a tree, Dashie!

</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Braeburn, listen, somethin' terrible's happened–
</dd><dd><b>Braeburn</b>: Terrible is right, your train is a full seven
minutes late! That's seven minutes less for you to delight in the
pleasures and wonders of... A-A-A-ppleloosa! Boggles the mind, we
settler ponies built all this in just the past year, don't it?! And as
you can see, we have all of the finest comforts. Like horse-drawn
carriages!
</dd><dd><b>"Black Stone"</b>: Okay, you pull now.
</dd><dd><b>Noteworthy</b>: Aww, we just switched.
</dd><dd><b>Braeburn</b>: And those there are horse-drawn horse-drawn carriages.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: ...Listen, Braeburn, I– Oof!
</dd><dd><b>Braeburn</b>: And here's our local waterin' hole, the Salt Block.
</dd><dd><b>"Morton Saltworthy"</b>: That's enough salt for you!
</dd><dd><b>Ol' Salt</b>: Can't I at least... get a glass of water?
</dd><dd><b>Braeburn</b>: Over there's the office of Sheriff Silverstar. And here's where we have our wild west dances! And here's where we have our <i>mild</i> west dances!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: But, Braeburn, we–
</dd><dd><b>Braeburn</b>: And here's the most wonderful sight in all of... A-A-A-ppleloosa! Our apple orchard.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Braeburn!
</dd><dd><b>Braeburn</b>: First harvest should be any day now.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Braebu–
</dd><dd><b>Braeburn</b>: Good thing too!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Brae–
</dd><dd><b>Braeburn</b>: 'Cause we need that grub to live on.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Braeburn!
</dd><dd><b>Braeburn</b>: Uh, yes, cuz?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: You have a very nice town an' all, but we have a <i>hu-uge</i> problem! Some of our friends are missin'!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: A stampede of buffalo.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: They took Spike!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Rainbow Dash went after them!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: And we can't find Pinkie Pie.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: And we had an apple tree with us for your orchard, but they took that too!
</dd><dd><b>Braeburn</b>: Did you say... buffalo? [sigh] Them buffalo,
they want us settler ponies to take every single tree you see here off
this land. They sure as hay don't want any new ones added in.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: But why?
</dd><dd><b>Braeburn</b>: Beats me. We put a lot of hard work into this
land, so we can feed our town, our families, our foals! And now they're
sayin' all these trees have to go? T'ain't fair...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ooh, I can't <i>wait</i> to get my hooves on that little buffalo... Hnnh... Ow! Nobody tricks Rainbow Dash and gets away with it.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Boo!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yah! ...Pinkie Pie!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ah, ya caught me! Looks like I tricked you and didn't get away with it either! You're good.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Shhshh! What do you think you're doing?! You gotta get out of here!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I do?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You're gonna blow my cover.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I am?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'm trying to save Spike!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh my gosh! So am I!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: And the more of us there are out here, the
 more chances of us getting... caught. Run, Pinkie, I'll hold 'em off.
Save yourself!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Stop! Dash, Pinkie, 'sup? Hey, no worries, I know those guys. They're cool.
</dd><dd><b>Buffalo</b>: If you say so, Spike. Catch ya later, bro.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: Seems they took <i>me</i> by mistake. And they
feel awful about it too, poor guys. Fortunately, they totally respect
dragons, so they treat me like an honored guest.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sniff] Ugh...
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Still don't like ponies much, though... But you're with me, so it's cool.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Huh. Well, I still don't trust them. I say we turn tail and bail while we still–
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Mmm! [munching] Before we finish eating? Are
 you loco in the coco?! Can I please have more of that mushy stuff,
whatever it was?
</dd><dd><b>Little Strongheart</b>: Certainly. And, Mr. Spike, you like gemstones, yes?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Turquoise. Mmm! [munching] Heh hah! This here is Little Strongheart, and these are my friends Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You!
</dd><dd><b>Little Strongheart</b>: You!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That's it! We are outta here!
</dd><dd><b>Little Strongheart</b>: Wait! Please accept my apologies for what happened on the train. We didn't mean for anyone to be hurt.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, right.
</dd><dd><b>Little Strongheart</b>: We only wanted the tree. The settler
 ponies have overtaken the land and have planted an orchard all over it!
 Because of their thoughtlessness, we can no longer run over our
traditional stampeding grounds.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b> and <b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Huh?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I think it's time they met Chief Thunderhooves.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Chief Thunderhooves</b>: Hmmh. We have a long and winding
stampeding trail that we have run upon for many generations. [breath] My
 father stampeded upon these grounds, and his father before him, and his
 father before him, and his father before him, and his father before
him, and–
</dd><dd><b>Little Strongheart</b>: I think they get the idea, Chief.
</dd><dd><b>Chief Thunderhooves</b>: Hmph. It is a sacred tradition to
run the path every year. But this year, these... settler ponies,
these... [snort] Appleloosans! [snorting]
</dd><dd><b>Little Strongheart</b>: They planted apple trees all over it without asking our permission.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Well <i>that's</i> not very nice. Right, Rainbow Dash?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hmph...
</dd><dd><b>Little Strongheart</b>: The ponies refused to move their trees, so we are stuck here, and it is not fair!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: See, Rainbow Dash? They had a good reason to–
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Huh... Ah!
</dd><dd>[buffalo gasp]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'll say they had a good reason! C'mon. We have some apple-pickin' Appleloosans to talk to!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Ow! [groaning] Gently, please!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Sorry, Rarity, but our friends are out there
and we have ta' be ready for a long hike into buffalo territory if we're
 gonna save 'em! Let's go!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hi, guys!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Pinkie! We're so glad you're safe.
</dd><dd>[indistinct "Oh, there you are!" "Thank goodness!"]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: How did you escape from the buffalo?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: We didn't!
</dd><dd>[ponies gasp]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: We promised the buffalo a chance to talk.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Oh, yeah? 'Bout what?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: We brought our new pal Little Strongheart
here to explain to the Appleloosans why they should move the apple trees
 off buffalo land.
</dd><dd><b>Braeburn</b>: That information would be quite help–
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: That's weird. 'Cause my cousin Braeburn here wants to explain to the buffalo why they should let the apple trees stay.
</dd><dd><b>Little Strongheart</b>: That would be a useful thing to–
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: The land is theirs! You planted the trees not knowing that. Honest mistake. Now, you just gotta move 'em, that's all.
</dd><dd><b>Braeburn</b>: Well... heh...
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: They busted their rumps here! An' now they're
 supposed ta bust their rumps again, just 'cause some buffalo won't
stampede someplace else?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Plant the trees somewhere else!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Where?! It's the only flatland around these parts!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: The <i>buffalo</i> had it <i>first</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: The settler ponies need it to <i>live</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Come <i>on</i>, Applejack!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [over Rainbow Dash] You're bein' unreasonable!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [over Applejack] I put my hoof down!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Look! Both the settlers and the buffalo have good reasons to use this land. There must be something we can do.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hey! I've got an idea!
