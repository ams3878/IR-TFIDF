</dd><dd>[running footsteps]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: It is <i>gorgeous</i> out. Just gorgeous!
</dd><dd>[running footsteps]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [slurp]
</dd><dd>[running footsteps]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Twi... light! ...I... have... Lemme just... [deep breath] [belch]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Dear Twilight, I am sure you are as excited as I am about the upcoming wedding in Canterlot.</i> [to the others] Wedding? [reading] <i>I
 will be presiding over the ceremony, but would very much like you and
your friends to help with the preparations for this wonderful occasion.
Fluttershy, I would like you and your songbird choir to provide the
music.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh my goodness! What an honor!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Pinkie Pie, I can think of no one more qualified than you to host the reception.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hip, hip, hooray!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Applejack, you will be in charge of the catering for the reception.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, color me pleased as punch!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Rainbow Dash–</i>
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [yawn]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>...I would very much appreciate it if you could perform a sonic rainboom as the bride and groom complete their "I do"'s.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: <i>Yes</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Rarity, you will be responsible for designing the dresses for the bride and her bridesmaids.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Princess Celestia wants me to– [unintelligible] ...wedding dress? For a Canterlot wedding... I, ah, ooh, oooh!
</dd><dd>[thump]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>And as for you, Twilight, you will
be playing the most important role of all: Making sure that everything
goes as planned. See you all very soon. Yours, Princess Celestia.</i> But... I don't understand. Who's getting married?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh, wait! Uh, I was probably supposed to give you this one first.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Princess Celestia cordially invites you to the wedding of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and...</i> [gasp] My brother?!

<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Your brother's getting married? Congratulations, Twilight! That's great news!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah, <i>great</i> news. That I just got from a <i>wedding invitation</i>!
 Not from my brother, but from a piece of paper! Thanks a lot, Shining
Armor. I mean, really, he couldn't tell me personally? [as <b>Shining Armor</b>]
 Hey, Twilight, just thought you should know I'm making a really big
decision that changes everything. Oh, never mind, you'll hear about it
when you get the invitation. [normal] Princess <i>Mi Amore Cadenza</i>? Who in the hoof is that?! [snort]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, Twilight? Are you okay?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Sorry, it's just that Shining Armor
and I have always been so close. He's my B.B.B.F.F! [beat] Big Brother
Best Friend Forever?
</dd><dd><b>Rest of main cast</b>: Ohhh!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Before I came here and learned the
importance of friendship, Shining Armor was the only pony I ever really
accepted as a friend.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>When I was just a filly, I found it rather silly
</dd><dd>To see how many other ponies I could meet
</dd><dd>I had my books to read, didn't know that I would ever need
</dd><dd>Other ponies to make my life complete
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>But there was one colt that I cared for
</dd><dd>I knew he would be there for me
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>My big brother, best friend forever!
</dd><dd>Like two peas in a pod, we did everything together
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>He taught me how to fly a kite (Best friend forever!)
</dd><dd>We never had a single fight (We did everything together!)
</dd><dd>We shared our hopes, we shared our dreams
</dd><dd>I miss him more than I realized
</dd><dd>It seems...
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>[Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity]</b>
<dl><dd>Your big brother, best friend forever
</dd><dd>Like two peas in a pod, you did everything together
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>[Twilight Sparkle]</b>
<dl><dd>And though he's, oh, so far away
</dd><dd>I hoped that he would stay
</dd><dd>My big brother best friend
</dd><dd>Forever...
</dd><dd>Forever...
</dd></dl>
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: As one of your P.F.F.'s... [beat] Pony Friends Forever...
</dd><dd><b>Rest of main cast</b>: Ohhh!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: ...I wanna tell you that I think your brother sounds like a real good guy.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: He is pretty special. I mean, they don't let just anypony be captain of the Royal Guard.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [chirp] So let me get this straight. We're helping out with the wedding of not only a princess, but a <i>captain of the Royal Guard?</i>
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I guess we are.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Ooh, ooh, oooh!
</dd><dd>[thump]
</dd><dd><b>Rest of main cast</b>: [excited chattering]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: A sonic rainboom? At a <i>wedding</i>?! Can you say "best wedding <i>ever</i>"?!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasp] [echoing] <i>Best wedding ever</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: So you all get to help with the big fancy wedding, but <i>I'm</i> the one who gets to host the bachelor party! I have just one question. What's a bachelor party?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>, <b> Rarity</b>, <b> Pinkie Pie</b>, <b> Applejack</b>, and <b> Fluttershy</b>: [laughter]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Why the long face, sugarcube?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm just thinking about Shining Armor.
 Ever since I moved to Ponyville, we've been seeing each other less and
less. And now that he's starting a new family with this "Princess Mi
Amore Ca-whatshername", we'll probably <i>never</i> see each other.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Come on, now. You're his sister. He'll always make time for you.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Couldn't seem to make time to tell me he was getting married.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: We're here, we're here!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Whoa, what's with all the guards?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I'm sure they're just taking the necessary precautions. Royal weddings do bring out the strangest ponies.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Aaaaaaaaa– [sneezes like a trumpet]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Now, let's get going! We've got work to do!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: And <i>you've</i> got a big brother to go congratulate.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah. <i>Congratulate</i>. And then give him a piece of my mind.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I've got something to say to you, mister.
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: Twily! Ah, I've missed, you, kid. How was the train ride? I–
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: How <i>dare</i> you not tell me in person that you were getting married! I'm your sister, for pony's sake!
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: It's not my fault! Princess Celestia has
requested a major increase in security. Didn't you see all the guards at
 the train station?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah, there's a big wedding coming up. Maybe you heard about it?
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: It has nothing to do with the wedding. A
threat has been made against Canterlot. We don't know who's responsible
for it, but Princess Celestia asked that I help provide additional
protection. This, you need to see.
</dd><dd>[pop]
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: [gasps] The burden of keeping Canterlot
safe and secure rests squarely on my shoulders. Staying focused on the
task at hand has been my top priority.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Okay, okay, I get it. You've got a
really important job protecting all of Canterlot with a force field only
 you can conjure up. But still... how could you not tell me about
something as big as your wedding? Am I not that important to you any
more?
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: Hey. You're my little sister. Of course you're important to me. But I'd understand if you didn't want to be my best mare now.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You want <i>me</i> to be your best mare?
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: Well... yeah.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'd be honored! But I'm still pretty
ticked you're marrying somepony I don't even know! When did you even
meet this "Princess Mi Amore Cadenza"?
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: Twily, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza is Cadance, your old foalsitter.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Cadance? As in <i>the</i> Cadance? As in the greatest foalsitter in all the history of foalsitters?!
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: [chuckles] You tell me. She was <i>your</i> foalsitter.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ohmygoshohmygosh! Cadance is only the most amazing pony ever! She's beautiful, she's caring, she's kind...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Young Twilight Sparkle</b>: I am so lucky to have you as my foalsitter!
</dd><dd><b>Young Cadance</b>: I'm the one who's lucky, Twilight.
</dd><dd><b>Young Twilight Sparkle</b>: [scoffs] You're a <i>princess</i>. I'm just a regular old unicorn.
</dd><dd><b>Young Cadance</b>: You are <i>anything</i> but a regular old unicorn.
</dd><dd><b>Young Twilight</b> and <b>Young Cadance</b>: Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake! [laughing]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Wild Fire</b>: I am going for a hooficure and that is that!
</dd><dd><b>Lucky Clover</b>: You are not going–
</dd><dd><b>Wild Fire</b>: I am! I am!
</dd><dd><b>Lucky Clover</b>: I've already paid for three this month!
</dd><dd><b>Wild Fire</b>: I... no! My girlfriends are all getting their hooves done! And you said that onl–
</dd><dd><b>Lucky Clover</b>: Please, we've done this at least–
</dd><dd><b>Lucky Clover</b> and <b>Wild Fire</b>: [suddenly stop arguing]
</dd><dd><b>Lucky Clover</b>: Oh! Ho, ho, ho.
</dd><dd><b>Wild Fire</b>: Oh, sweetie. You just did that face.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: How many unicorns can just spread love wherever they go? I only know of one! And <i>you're</i> marrying her! [sing-song voice] You're marrying Cadance! You're marrying Cadance!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: I hope I'm not interrupting anything important.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Cadance! Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: What are you doing?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Cadance, it's me, Twilight!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: [uninterested] Uh-huh.
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: I've gotta get back to my station, but
Cadance will be checking in with all of you to see how things are going.
 I think I speak for both of us when I say we couldn't be more excited
to have you here. Right, dear?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: Absolutely.
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: Well, we'll let you get to it.
</dd></dl>

</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Cake, check. Ice sculpture, check. Best darn bite-size apple fritter you ever tasted...
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Mmm. Check.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [deep voice] I do. Do you? [high voice] I do! [kissing noises] [laughs nervously]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hiya, Princess!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: Please, call me Princess Mi Amore Cadenza.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hiya, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza. You come to check out what's on the menu for your big day?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: I have!
</dd><dd>[sinister chords]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: [gulp] Delicious! I love-love-love them. [laughs nervously]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Aw, shucks. Why don't you take a few to go?
[squee] I know how you brides can be. So busy, you forget to get a
little somethin' in your belly.
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd>[door closes]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Did... you see what she...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, you should have seen how she acted
back there. I don't know when she changed, but she changed! [imitating
Cadance] "Please, call me Princess Mi Amore Cadenza."
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: Did I hear someone say my name?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Your highness! Let me just start by saying what an honor it is to play a role in such a momentous occasion. [laughs nervously]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: [unenthusiastically] Uh-huh. Is my dress ready?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [stammers] Yes, of course. Um, I've been working
 on it ever since I was given the assignment, and I think you'll be
pleased with the results! Mmm!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: I was hoping for something with more beading and a longer train.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, yes, of course.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: And those should be a different color.
</dd><dd><b>Twinkleshine</b>: I think they're lovely.
</dd><dd><b>Minuette</b>: Me too!
</dd><dd><b>Lyra Heartstrings</b>: I love them.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: Make them a different color.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Gee, maybe her name should be "Princess Demandy-pants."
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[pop]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Okay, let me see. We've been over the games... [rattles dice] ...the dances...
</dd><dd>[polka from Swarm of the Century plays and stops]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] I think this reception is gonna be perfect! Don't you?
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: Perfect! ...If we were celebrating a six-year-old's birthday party.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] Thank you!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: Rest, my sister. As always, I will guard the night.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Bet I can guess what you're all thinking. Cadance is the absolute worst bride-to-be ever.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [high voice] Who, me?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Spike! That goes on the cake.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [laughs nervously]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Twilight, whatever are you talking about? Cadance is an absolute gem!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Rarity, she was so demanding!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, of course she is! Why shouldn't she expect the very best on her wedding day?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Applejack, did you know that after she
 told you how much she just 'love-love-loved' your hors d'eouvres, she
threw them in the trash?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Aw, she was probably just trying to spare my feelin's.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No, she was just being fake and totally insincere!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: She did raise her voice at one of my birds during rehearsal.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: See? Rude!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: But he <i>was</i> singing really off-key.
</dd><dd>[bird sings off-key]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie Pie, you had to have noticed how Cadance treated–
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b> and <b>Spike</b>: [kissing noises and laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Never mind. Rainbow Dash, you're with me, right?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Sorry, Twi. Been too busy prepping for my sonic rainboom to pay much attention to the bride's bad attitude.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [growls]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: The princess is about to get married. I'm sure any negative behavior she might be displaying is simply the result of nerves.
</dd><dd>[thump]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And <i>I'm</i> sure it's the result of being an awful pony who doesn't deserve to even know Shining Armor, let alone marry him!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Think maybe you're bein' just a tiny bit possessive of your brother?
</dd><dd><b>Rest of main cast</b>: Uh-huh.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I am <i>not</i> being possessive, and I am <i>not</i>
 taking it out on Cadance! You're all just too caught up in your wedding
 planning to notice that maybe there shouldn't even [thumps table] <i>be</i> a wedding!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[knocking]
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: Twily! Your big brother's looking pretty good, don't you think? Huh. Everything okay?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We need to talk. I think you're making a big–
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: [clears throat]
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: Oh, uh, hi, sweetie.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: She sure has a way of sneaking up on people.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: Could I speak to you for a moment, dear?
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: Better see what she wants.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: [muffled] Look, we need to talk.
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: [muffled] I'm here to talk.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: [muffled] It's about your sister, okay?
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: [muffled] I– look, look, she's okay–
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: [muffled] Just... listen to me, (over Shining Armor) alright? No no–
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: [muffled] I'm listening, I'm listening.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: [muffled] I thought I made it perfectly clear I didn't want you to wear that.
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: This was my favorite uncle's.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: And?
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: And I think I should wear it.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: Are you disagreeing with me?
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: I guess I am– Ah!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: Oh, dear. Are you getting another one of your headaches?
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: Gyah!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: Feeling better?
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: [grunts] Mm-hmm.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: She isn't just unpleasant and rude. She's downright evil!
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: Twilight!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: Let her go.
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: Huh. It seemed like she had something else she wanted to tell me.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Princess Luna</b>: Who goes there? Stay indoors, Twilight Sparkle.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Shining Armor's in real trouble! You have to help–
</dd><dd><b>Rest of main cast</b>: [various chatter]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Dresses? What are you–?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Can you believe it? We're gonna be Princess Mi Amore Cadenza's new bridesmaids!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>New</i> bridesmaids? What happened to her <i>old</i> bridesmaids?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: She didn't say. But she did tell us that she would love-love-<i>love</i> it if we'd fill in for them.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Seeing as we've been working so hard and everything.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: And you had your doubts about her.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Told you she was an absolute gem!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You sure this is what I should wear? Doesn't seem all that aerodynamic.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Hmm. I'll see what I can do.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>, <b>Pinkie Pie</b>, and <b>Fluttershy</b>: [excited chatter and laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Looks like I really am on my own.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[church organ music]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: Perfect, girls. No need to rush. Then of course, Cadance will enter.
</dd><dd>[Wagner's "Bridal Chorus" plays]
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: I'll say a few words, and then we'll begin with the vows. Shining Armor, you'll get the ring from your best mare.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [deep voice] Do you? [high voice] I do!
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: Hey... has anypony seen Twilight?
</dd><dd>[doors open]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm here! I'm <i>not</i> gonna stand next to her! And neither should you!
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: I'm sorry, I... I don't know why she's acting like this.
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: Maybe we should just ignore her.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You have to listen to me!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, goodness! Are you okay?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm fine.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Ya sure about that?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I've got something to say! She's <i>evil</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Rest of main cast</b>: [concerned chattering]
</dd><dd><b>Royal guard</b>: [inaudible comment to other guard]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: She's been horrible to my friends,
she's obviously done something to her bridesmaids, and if that wasn't
enough, I saw her put a spell on my brother that made his eyes go all
[bells jangling]!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: [starts crying] Why are you doing this to me?!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Because you're evil!
</dd><dd><b>Princess Cadance</b>: [crying]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Evil! And if I don't stop you, you're gonna ruin my brother's life!
</dd><dd>[smack]
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: You want to know why my eyes went all
[bells jangling]? Nuh! Because ever since I started having to perform my
 protection spell, I've been getting terrible migraines. Cadance hasn't
been casting spells on me. She's been using her magic to <i>heal</i> me!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [inhales]
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: And she decided to replace her bridesmaids because she found out the only reason they wanted to be <i>in</i>
 the wedding was so that they could meet Canterlot royalty! And if she
hasn't been on her best behavior with your [stomps hoof] friends, it's
because with me being so busy, she's had to make all the decisions about
 the wedding!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I was just trying to–
</dd><dd><b>Shining Armor</b>: She's been completely stressed out
because it's really important to her that our big day be perfect!
Something that obviously wasn't important to <i>you</i>! [gasps] Now if
you'll excuse me, I have to go and comfort my bride. And you can forget
about being my best mare. In fact, if I were you, I wouldn't show up to
the wedding at all.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: C'mon, y'all. Let's go check on the princess.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I was–
</dd><dd><b>Princess Celestia</b>: You have a lot to think about.
</dd><dd>[doors slam]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Maybe I was being overprotective. I could've gained a sister. But instead... I just lost a brother.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>He was my big brother, best friend
</dd><dd>Forever...
</dd><dd>And now, we'll never do anything
</dd><dd>Together...

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm sorry!
