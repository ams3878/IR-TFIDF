</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [grunts, to Twilight] Do we wanna know why you're wrapping up everypony in town?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Not <i>wrapping</i> paper. A to-do list.
</dd><dd>[teleportation zaps]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Two of these! Three of those! I'm gonna need <i>ten</i> of those! Just in case!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Twilight, darling, are you all right?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Sure! Just-grabbing-a-few-things-do-I-need-this-no-that's-silly-I-need-<i>eight!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hey, y'all! What's everypony—? Ohhh. Traditional holiday meltdown?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>, <b>Fluttershy</b>, <b>Rarity</b>, <b>Spike</b>, <b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Uh-huh.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [hyperventilating]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [calmly and quietly] Hey, Twilight. How's your day?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I got way behind grading midterms, and
 Cadance and Shining Armor are coming here with Flurry Heart for
Hearth's Warming Eve, and I haven't started decorating, and I don't know
 what to get any of you, and—!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Stop! Take a breath.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [inhales deeply]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Now let it out sloooooooooowwww...
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [exhales slowly]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Now, I think I have an idea that might help. What if we change up how we give gifts this year and do a Hearthswarmin' Helper?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: What's a Hearthswarming Helper?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Whenever the <i>whole</i> Apple family got
together, there were just so many of us, it didn't make sense to buy
everypony gifts. So we'd put our names in a hat...
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ooh, a game of chance! Tell me more.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: ...then we'd pull a name, but keep it a secret.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: A dash of mystery. Good. Good.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Instead of buyin' everypony a present, you just get one for the pony you picked from the hat.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Wait. So instead of lots of presents, I only buy one of you a present? <i>What kind of game is this?!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, it <i>would</i> save time.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: And you could get the pony you pick something <i>really</i> nice. [sighs]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [clears throat] The less shopping, the better. In!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Will that help, Twilight?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I <i>was</i> stressed about shopping.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [sighs] Fine. I will only buy <i>one</i> present for my secret Hearthswarming Helper buddy.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: We just need to put everypony's name in this here hat.
</dd><dd>[ripping and writing]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Y'all ready? No peekin'.
</dd><dd>[music]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: So excited! Aah! Too excited! I don't wanna give anything away!
</dd><dd>[zipping]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Wheeee!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: When will the gift exchange occur?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: How about Twilight's castle tomorrow night, Hearth's Warming Eve?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: That's perfect! Pinkie and I can spend the evenin' with y'all and the next mornin' with our families!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And thanks to all of you, I should be ready to celebrate by then!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, this is so exciting!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Uh... Um, Applejack, is it against the rules to
trade names? Like if I had a better idea for somepony special? I mean
specific?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: If you can figure out who has the pony you want and they're okay with tradin', I guess it's fine.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Great! So, uh, who do you—?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I don't have Rarity.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: What?! That's not who I—!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh-huh.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[doors open]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Heeeey, Twilight! Whatcha planning to get <i>your</i> secret pony?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Not sure. I'm getting the castle ready for my family first. Then I'll shop.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Maybe something sparkly? Fashionable?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No! Those aren't really the kind of things my pony likes.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh. Welp, gotta go! Wish me luck!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: With shopping?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Well, yeah! If everypony's only getting <i>one</i> gift, we have a ton of responsibility to make sure it's extra-<i>special</i> good.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I didn't think of it that way. The
present I get for Pinkie Pie should make or break her holiday. I can't
just go shopping and hope to find something nice. This needs
forethought, planning, research! I'll decoarate later. Knowing Pinkie,
she probably already has a <i>perfect</i> idea what to get <i>her</i> pony.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I have no idea what to get my pony!
</dd><dd><b>Limestone Pie</b>: There's a pile of presents right there. Pick one, and you're done.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>Those</i> were for when I was getting <i>all</i> of my friends matching harmony Hearth's Warming hats! Now it's just Twilight! [sobs] I can't give <i>one</i> pony a matching present with nothing to match it! I need something special for only her!
</dd><dd>[shatter!]
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] I've got it.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I don't think Twilight likes rocks as much as you do, Maud.
</dd><dd><b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] Don't rock it 'til you try it.
</dd><dd>[boing!]
</dd><dd><b>Marble Pie</b>: [giggles]
</dd><dd><b>Gummy</b>: [sticks tongue out]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Thanks for the vote of confidence, Gummy. But this is the biggest holiday challenge I've ever faced!
</dd><dd>[crunch!]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [to Limestone] Uh, this one's for you. Hey!
This is the biggest holiday challenge I've ever faced! How exciting is
that?! Am I up for the challenge? I know I'm good at gift-giving, but am
 I the <i>best</i> at gift-giving?
</dd><dd><b>Limestone Pie</b>: Who would say they're the best at gift-giving? That's ridiculous.
</dd><dd><b>Marble Pie</b>: Uhhhh—
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Marble, you're a genius! Yaks would say
they're the best at gift-giving! If anypony knows what to do, it's them!
 I gotta go to Yakyakistan! Thanks! These Pie sister talks are the best!
 [smooching]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: Pinkie!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I don't have Rarity!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Whoa!
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh! [chuckles] How's your shopping going, Spike?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Uh, fine!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [whispering] Which pony did you get?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I can't... remember?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I've got Applejack, darling. She's going to
adore her present. There's a brilliant designer in Manehattan – Fedora
Felt – who makes the most marvelous hats. I asked for a new take on
western chic that would be the envy of every farm pony in Equestria.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: That's a great gift, Rarity. I hope I can find something for <i>my</i> pony as special as you are. Uh, <i>she</i> is! U-Uh, bye!
</dd><dd>[zip!]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Okay, what about your favorite food?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Ooh. I couldn't pick just one. What if it hurt the other foods' feelings?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Riiiiight... But there's gotta be something you really, really like.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I really, really like... everything! Why do you ask?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Juuuust getting gift ideas. Uh, for my pony. Who isn't you. So, uh, is there anything you <i>don't</i> like?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Hmmm... Not liking things!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [groaning]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I hope that helped!
</dd><dd>[sparkly sounds]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Hey, Fluttershy! Thinking of getting that for your Hearthswarming Helper?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Mm-hmm. She loves shiny things.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [overacted] I wish I knew what <i>my</i> secret pony wanted. She's so hard to shop for.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, no. Maybe I could help. Unless you don't want to—
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Rainbow Dash.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh! I was just talking to Rainbow Dash about these—
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Great idea! We <i>should</i> trade ponies!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Wait. Trade?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Well, Applejack said it's not against the rules.
And you know what Rainbow Dash likes, so it's perfect. [gasps] Rarity?!
What a surprise! [chuckles] Thanks!
</dd><dd>[zip!]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: There you are! I need your help.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Do you want to trade names, too?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: What? No. I just need help figurin' out what to get Spike.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Phew!

</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Candle. Great. Whatever. Fluttershy-shopping done.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Ugh. You can't honestly be serious.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ghost candle!
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: A candle is what you buy when you have no idea what to get somepony.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [groans] What do you want, Discord?
</dd><dd>[poof]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Fluttershy told me about this Hearth's
whatever-it's-called. I may not be invited, but I wanted to make sure
she gets a quality gift.
</dd><dd>[clunk]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I tried asking her what she likes, but she likes everything.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Well, she <i>says</i> that, but her <i>real</i> friends know what she <i>actually</i> likes.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I've known her a lot longer than you have.
</dd><dd>[poof]
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Then you must surely know that lit candles around adorably flammable animals make her nervous, don't you?
</dd><dd>[sheep bleats]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [groans] Fine. I'll get her something else.
</dd><dd>[plane engine roaring]

</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Whoa!

</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: You seem like somepony looking for a gift for a very special friend.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I am!
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: A friend who wouldn't want to miss out on the must-have gift everypony is talking about?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: She certainly wouldn't wanna miss out on <i>that</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Flim</b>: A truly awesome friend who deserves something twenty percent cooler than any other gift out there?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: That sounds <i>just</i> like her!

</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Uh, Rarity?
</dd><dd><b>Derpy</b>: [clears throat, mumbles] Oh! Here we go! Your package was delivered to Sweet Apple Acres.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: What?! It was supposed to be delivered to Rarity's Boutique!
</dd><dd><b>Derpy</b>: Um... okay... but... now, the package was for Applejack, and she is at Sweet Apple Acres.

</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Why is that a relief?!
</dd><dd><b>Derpy</b>: Because Applejack's not <i>in</i> Sweet Acorn Orchard. Do you want me to get the package and deliver it to her?

</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Even worse!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh, come on!  Fluttershy would <i>love</i> a spa day!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Really? Love the stress of deciding which
treatment to get? Love worrying that she's not relaxing enough? Or
relaxing too much? And what about all those sweet animals she's left
alone?! So much to worry about, and all because of <i>you</i>.

</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, if you're such an expert on Fluttershy, what did <i>you</i> get her?
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Oh, and you honestly expect me to tell you what
 I got Fluttershy so that you can one-up me? Well, I have half a mind to
 stop you entirely.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Good! Please stop helping me! I'm begging you!
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Well, I suppose I <i>could</i> tell you what my backup present was.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sarcastically] Great. Still helping.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: It would've made a lovely addition to her
animal sanctuary. But you have to be the fastest pony in Equestria to
even have a chance of—
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. You're <i>talking</i> to the fastest pony in Equestria! If there's some fast animal out there Fluttershy would love, <i>I'm</i> the one who can get it.
</dd><dd><b>Discord</b>: Oh, I just don't know.

<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The ideal gift for Pinkie Pie needs to
be A – unique, B – specific to her personality, and C – food-based. What
 is a unique food? Cupcakes? Nah. Cookies? Nope. Pies? Pastries?
Pudding? [gasps] Wait! [echoing] <i>Puuuuuuuuuuuudding!</i> [reading]
"After defeating the Windigos, the Earth pony, Pegasi, and unicorn
nations prepared the first Hearth's Warming meal together. Chancellor

<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I've narrowed down my choices for Spike to fire-dancing sticks, or a <i>Power Ponies</i> comic. Unenchanted, I think. Aah! What is <i>that?!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Holly the Hearth's Warmer doll. Isn't she sweet?

</dd><dd><b>Holly the Hearth's Warmer Doll</b>: [Flim's voice] <i>I love being an expensive toy!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Egh. Why'd you think <i>that</i> was a good gift for Rainbow Dash?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: It's the must-have gift of the season. And in short supply.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: "Short supply", huh? How much did that set you back?
