</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hey, Rarity. Hey, Pinkie Pie. What are you looking at?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Rainbow Dash! Isn't she the most daring devil? I mean, the most devilish darer? I mean—
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: She's dazzling!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ooh, yeah, that's a good word. She's <i>dazzling</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>, <b>Rarity</b>, and <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasp]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh no, oh no, oh no!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ai yi yi yi yi!

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>, <b>Rarity</b> and <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oohh.

</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [muffled] Is she gonna be okay?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [muffled] Oh, I'm so worried!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [muffled] Is her face gonna stay that way?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Awwww.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: How is she, doctor?
</dd><dd><b>Doctor Horse</b>: She's going to be fine. Luckily she has friends like you who got her over here in a jiffy.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Huh, how long do I need to lie here? I've got things I need to do!
</dd><dd><b>Doctor Horse</b>: Well, that all depends on your recovery, but I'd say a few days minimum.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You guys have gotta get me out of here! I'm gonna climb the walls!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ooh, just like a spider! [to Doctor Horse] Did the crash somehow give her super-duper spider powers?
</dd><dd><b>Doctor Horse</b>: Nnnno, nor did it give her amazing healing powers. She needs to stay in bed for a few days.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Few days? Might as well be a few months, or a few years!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: It's not so bad, Rainbow Dash.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I bet the chow in here is hoof-lickin' good.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: And the hospital gowns, they...match the curtains!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: And look! You have a roommate!
</dd><dd>[wheels squeaking]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What's this? 'Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Stone'.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: This is the first story in the series. I own all of them. [squee]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: No thanks. I <i>so</i> don't read. I'm a world-class athlete. Reading's for eggheads like you, Twilight. Heh, no offense, but I am <i>not</i> reading. It's undeniably, unquestionably, uncool.
</dd><dd><b>Rest of main cast</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Is she serious? Who doesn't like to read a bang-up tale from time to time?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Why, a good book is almost as magnificent as silk pajamas on a Sunday morning, heh!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Reading is for everypony, Rainbow Dash!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yeah! I love reading, and my head isn't even
 close to the shape of an egg! It's more the shape of an apple, or maybe
 an orange, but a <i>big</i> orange! More like a grapefruit really...
</dd><dd><b>"Nurse Sweetheart"</b>: All right, my little ponies. Rainbow Dash needs her rest. You'll have to come back tomorrow.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I think you'd like Daring. She's a lot like you. Adventurous, fierce, and undeniably, unquestionably, unstoppable.

</dd><dd>[Dash's head banging on bed]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sighs] [unenthusiastically] "As Daring Do
 trekked through the tropical jungle, the wet heat sapped her energy and
 slowed her every step. If only she could escape this oppressive
atmosphere and fly up into the cool blue sky. But her crash landing in
the jungle had injured her wing and she was grounded for a few days. Few
 days... it might as well be a few months, or a few years!" Huh. I'm
right there with you, sister.

<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [voiceover] "The mosquitoes buzzed loudly.
The macaws cried from the high trees. Yet all of these distracting
noises were not enough to cover the sound of the predators following her
 every step."

</dd><dd>[kitten mewing]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [voiceover, steadily getting more excited]
 "Safely landing on the other side, Daring finally allowed herself a
moment to breathe. She turned around to find herself face to face with
the long lost temple that she had sought tirelessly for over sixty days
and nights!"

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We brought your favorite board game!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: We know how much you like to win!

</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [short nervous laugh] No no, you first.

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Uh... cloud two?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You zapped my weather pony! Uh-huh, you
stung my bumblebee. Oh, my thunderbolt. Aw, and that's my last cloud.
You found it. Guess you guys win, I lose. [nickers]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: But Rainbow Dash, you, you didn't even get a turn.

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But yesterday you were desperate for things to do!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Do? Who said anything about Daring Do? I told you I'm not interested in reading. [yawns] It's nap time for me! [mocks snoring]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Glad we could... cheer you up?

</dd><dd><b>Doctor Horse</b>: I was touching your good wing.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, right. Well, I think that one's hurting now too.
</dd><dd><b>Doctor Horse</b>: [chuckles] I think I know what the trouble is. A severe case of lazy-itis.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: B-But, you got me all wrong, Doc! I'm not being lazy!

</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh, thanks, Twilight. I'm sorry I made
such a big deal about all of this. I thought reading was just for smart
ponies like you.

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Reading is something everypony can enjoy, if they just give it a try.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, I get it. <i>I shouldn't knock something until I've tried it.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That's a great lesson, and it would make a great letter to the Princess.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [to Spike] Didja get all that?
