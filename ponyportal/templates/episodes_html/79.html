</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: It was like a little slice of heaven.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: With ice cream on top!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Fluttershy, I cannot believe your spectacular voice isn't part of the Pony Tones quartet!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, well, I—
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Especially since you're having us perform for your Ponyville Pet Center fundraiser tomorrow night!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Well, you see, I—
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: This simply <i>must</i> be rectified. You <i>must</i> share that stunning voice at the event!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yeah! It'll be so amazing! You'll be there
on stage, basking in the hooflights! The center of attention! A shining
star! Everypony staring at you, judging you, jealously noting how they
could be <i>way</i> better than you! Why wasn't it them? <i>Why wasn't it them?</i> And then, when you choke, they'll turn on you, becoming a seething, angry mob, and you'll be horribly humiliated, <i>never able to show your face in Ponyville again!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Pinkie Pie!
</dd><dd>[thwack]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Don't be ridiculous!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Aw, but I'm so good at it!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [sighs] Come, Fluttershy, you will join the group, making the Pony Tones quartet the Pony Tones <i>quintet</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: No.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Pardon me?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I love the Pony Tones, I'm one of their biggest fans, but I do <i>not</i> want to perform with them.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Why not, Fluttershy?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Well, you see... I... I have... um... I... I have...
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Spit it out!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I have... stage fright.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] Is it contagious?!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Stage fright isn't a disease, Pinkie. It just means that Fluttershy is scared to perform in front of everypony.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I'm very thankful the Pony Tones are singing at the Pet Center fundraiser, and I'm <i>really</i> looking forward to the performance, but I'll be watching safely from the audience.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [sighs] Well... I think it's a terrible waste of an exquisite talent, but I understand that you're not comfortable.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Thank you. Oh! Angel's right. We'd better get going. There's a lot of work to do before tomorrow's event.

</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Who will take the title this year? Will it be
 somepony new? Or will the turkey call champion of six years defend his
title to make it lucky number seven?
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: We'll find out if you stop your gabbin' and get on with the gobblin'!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Alright, everypony! Let's talk turkey! Big Mac, you're up!
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: [inhales]

<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: A...a...a turkey call? You lost your voice doing a... a <i>turkey call</i>?!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Lost his voice <i>and</i> the title! [gobbles]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Now we can't perform tonight!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Wait, what? No! You have to perform! Otherwise, the fundraiser will be a disaster!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, we cannot perform tonight with only three voices.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Why not?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: It would take rearranging all the music, and we
just don't have time. I'm sorry, Fluttershy, but I have no remedy for
this situation.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [gasps] Of course! A remedy! Follow me!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Zecora</b>: Hmmm.
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: [croaking] Ahhhh.
</dd><dd><b>Zecora</b>: Hmmm.
</dd><dd><b>Big McIntosh</b>: [croaking] Ahhh—
</dd><dd><b>Zecora</b>: I can cure this pony that is hoarse, but it will take a longer course.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Uh, come again?
</dd><dd><b>Zecora</b>: Mm. I can mix a brew that can work just right, but it cannot heal him by tonight.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, no! Ah! Where are we ever going to find a deep voice to replace Big Mac's?
</dd><dd><b>Zecora</b>: [chuckles]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Pardon me, Zecora, but this is no laughing
matter! We need a bass voice for the harmonies to work! Without it, the
performance will be ruined!
</dd><dd><b>Zecora</b>: Please, forgive my strange elation, but I was not laughing at your situation.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Then what?
</dd><dd><b>Zecora</b>: Remember when you pony folk stumbled into poison joke? Miss Fluttershy had an unusual change, deepening her vocal range.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [from Bridle Gossip, deep male voice] I don't want to talk about it.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Yes, yes! Your voice became really low, making it sound like...
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [gasps] Flutterguy!
</dd><dd><b>Zecora</b>: With these leaves I can mix a brew, creating the same effect on you.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Zecora, that's fantastic!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Yes! I'll do it! I'd do <i>anything</i> for the animals!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Why, you'd even appear on stage!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh. Except that. I just can't bring myself to sing on stage in front of everypony.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: What if you sang <i>not</i> in front of everypony?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Huh?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: What if Big Mac was <i>on</i>stage, moving his lips while you're <i>behind</i> the curtains singing his part? It would be just like singing in your house! Nopony would know it was you!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Even still, I just don't think I could sing in front of...
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: You must! For the animals!
</dd><dd><b>Angel</b>: [squeaking]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh... Okay then... [gulps] Mix it up!

thank you all for coming out tonight and generously supporting the
Ponyville Pet Center! Thanks to your kindness, pets are finding loving
homes, and we're sure to meet our fundraising goal!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Where's Fluttershy?

<dl><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: <i>Sometimes, being afraid can stop you from
doing something that you love, but hiding behind these fears means
you're only hiding from your true self. It's much better to face those
fears so you can shine and be the best pony you can possibly be.</i>
