 down--swoosh--and right before she hit the ground--shoom-she pulled
up--vrrrmmm!

</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Mornin', Pinks. Gilda, this is my gal pal, Pinkie Pie.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Hey. What's up?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Pinkie, this is my griffon friend, Gilda.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: What's a griffon?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: She's half-eagle, half-lion.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: And <i>all</i> awesome. Raa. Heh-haa. Yeah, that's right.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Gilda's my best friend from my days at Junior Speedster flight camp. Hey, remember the chant?
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Sha, they made us recite it every morning, I'll never get that lame thing out of my head.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Sooo...
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Ugh. Only for you, Dash.

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [laughs] Oh that was awesome, and it gave me a great idea for a prank. Gilda, you game?
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Huh. Well, I groove on a good prank as much as
the next griffon. But Dash, you promised me we'd get a flying session in
 this morning.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, uh, well, Pinkie Pie, you don't mind, do you? Gilda just got here. We'll catch up with you later.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh. Um, well sure, no problem. Have fun you
guys, I'll, uh, just catch up with you-- [sigh] later. [blows party

<dl><dd><b>Gilda</b> and <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [laughing]

</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, only <i>faster</i>. So now what?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hey there.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b> and <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Huh?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: It's later. And I caught up.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Pinkie Pie, you are so random.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Hey Dash, think you got enough gas left to beat me to that cloud?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: A race? You are <i>so</i> on.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: One, two, three, <i>go</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>Hey!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I win.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: As if. I won, dude.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: No way.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Yes way.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh, come on, I was way ahead of you.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Uh, I don't think so.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh Geez, dream on.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Remember back in camp? I–
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: There is no way you beat me.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Whatever.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Wow guys, that was really close, but I think
 Rainbow Dash beat you by a teeny weeny itty bitty hair, or a teeny
weeny itty bitty feather.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hah, see? Good thing Pinkie Pie's here to keep you honest, <i>G</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Okay... Dash, last one to that cloud up there is a gnarly dragon egg. <i>Go</i>! [To Pinkie Pie] I think the high altitude is making you dizzy.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Wait, <i>guys!</i> Oh wow, you guys almost got away from me that time.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: So, Dash, got any new moves in your tricktionary, or are you 100% <i>old</i> school?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: New moves? Heh, sit back <i>G</i>, this is gonna take a while.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Hey Pinkie, c'mere.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yeah?
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Don't you know how to take <i>get lost</i> for an answer? Dash doesn't need to hang with a dweeb like you now that <i>I'm</i> around. You're dorkin' up the skies, Stinkie Pie, so make like a bee and <i>BUZZ OFF</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasp] Whaaa-aaa–
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Try matching <i>that</i>. Hey, where's Pinkie Pie and her crazy contraption?
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Eh, she left. Something about being <i>as busy as a bee</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>Hmph!</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: So Pinkie Pie, are you sure that this friend of Rainbow Dash is really so mean?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Um, <i>yeah</i>. She keeps stealing Rainbow
Dash away, she pops my balloons, and she told me to buzz off. I've never
 met a griffon this mean. Well, actually, I've never met a griffon at
all, but I bet if I had, she wouldn't have been as mean and grumpy as
Gilda.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You know what I think, Pinkie Pie.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hmm?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, I think... you're jealous.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>Jealous</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Green with envy. Well, in your case, <i>pink with envy</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, yes. Jealous. Listen Pinkie, I
don't want to upset you, but just because Rainbow Dash has another
friend doesn't make Gilda a grump. I mean, perhaps it's you, Pinkie, who
 needs to improve <i>her</i> attitude.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Improve <i>my</i> attitude? But I... D... B.. It's Gilda that... D... Are you seri... [scream of frustration]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sigh]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Maybe Twilight is right. Maybe Gilda isn't a
big meanie grumpy mean-meanie-pants. Maybe I'm just a big jealous
judgmental jealous-jealousy-pants. [sigh]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [sips]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [laughing] That was sweet. Ugh, I gotta
take care of a few weather jobs around here. Shouldn't take long. Just,
uh, hang out in town and I'll come find ya.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: That's cool, I guess. I'm gonna go chow down.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Later.
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: [sniffs] Aaah! A rattler, a <i>rattler</i>! Run for the hills! Everybody forsake yourselves!
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: This stuff ain't fresh, dude.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Aw, poor Granny Smith, she didn't know it was a joke. How mean. No, no, I can't misjudge her. It <i>was</i> kind of a funny prank, I guess.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: [chews]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasp] I <i>did</i> misjudge her. She's not only a meanie mean-pants, she's also a thief. Nonononono, she might give it back. It's just a joke.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: All right little ones, this way, this way. Mama duck, you're free and clear.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: <i>Hey.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Please excuse me.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: I'm walkin' here.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, um, I'm sorry. I-I-I was just trying to...
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: [mocking] <i>I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i> Why don't you just watch where you're going, doofus?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: B-b-b-but I... I...
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: [breathes in, roars]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [bleat] [sobs]
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Ugh, please, all these lame ponies are driving me buggy. I gotta bail.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: She's a grump, <i>and</i> a thief, <i>and</i> a bully. The meanest kind of mean meanie-pants there is. I can take it, but no one treats Fluttershy like that. <i>No</i>. <i>One</i>. This calls for extreme measures, Pinkie Pie style.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Welcome, welcome. Welcome!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Who's this Gilda I've heard nothing about?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I hear she's an old friend of Rainbow Dash. A griffon, so rare.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You've met Gilda, right? What's she like?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, um, well, I'll tell you later, Twilight.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Welcome. Welcome.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, Pinkie Pie, about this party for Gilda. Umm... Do you really think it's a good idea? I mean–
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Don't worry your pretty little head about mean old Gilda. Your auntie Pinkie Pie's got it all taken care of.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I'm a year older than you.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Gilda! I'm so honored to throw you one of my
 signature Pinkie Pie parties, and I really, truly, sincerely, hope you
feel welcome here amongst all us pony folk.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: [grunt]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [laughs]
</dd><dd>[laughter]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh Pinkie Pie, the old hoof-shake buzzer. You are a <i>scream</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Yeah [chuckles nervously] uh, good one, Pinkie Pie.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Come on <i>G</i>, I'll introduce you to some of my other friends.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Right behind you Dash. <i>I know what you're up to.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Great.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Rrrh. I know what you're <i>planning</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [giggles] Well, I hope so. This wasn't supposed to be a surprise party.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: I mean, I've got my eye on you.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: And <i>I</i> got my <i>eye</i> on <i>you</i>.
 Everyone, I'd like you all to meet Gilda, a long-time, dear friend of
Rainbow Dash. Let's honor her and welcome her to Ponyville.
</dd><dd>[ponies cheer]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Please help yourself.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Vanilla lemon drops. Don't mind if I do. <i>HOT</i>!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: <i>G</i>, the punch.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: [gasp] [gulp] Huh?
</dd><dd>[laughter]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Well, whaddya know, pepper in the vanilla lemon drops, and the punch served in a dribble glass.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ha. Priceless. Priceless. [laughs]
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: [gulp] [gasp] Yeah, <i>hilarious</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hey <i>G</i>, look, presents.
</dd><dd>[laughter]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Spittin' snakes. Hah, somepony pulled that prank on me last month.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Ha ha. I bet I know who <i>that</i> was.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You <i>do</i>?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[ponies chatter, birds singing]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Cake time everypony.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Hey, can I blow out the candles?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Why don't we let Gilda blow out the candles, Spike? She <i>is</i> the guest of honor after all.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Ugh.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Exactly. [gasp] [blow] [gasp] [blow]
</dd><dd>[laughter]
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: [continued gasping and blowing]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [laughs] Re-lighting birthday candles, I love that prank. What a classic.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Now, I wonder who could've done that.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Yeah, <i>I wonder.</i>
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Mmm, who cares. This cake is amazing.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Spike</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: What? It's great, try some.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hey <i>G</i>, you're not upset about some silly candles, are you?
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: No way, Dash. Like I said, I'm down with a good prank.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Come on then, let's have some cake.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Hey, I'm watching you. Like a hawk.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Why? Can't you watch me like a griffon?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hey y'all, it's pin the tail on the pony. Let's play.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, my favorite game. Can I go first? Can I have the purple tail?
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Well, <i>I</i> am the guest of honor, and I'll have the purple tail.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yeah, Gilda should definitely go first. Let's get you blindfolded.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Hey what-- ugh-- what are you doing? Rrrah.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: We're spinning you around and around and then you can pin the tail on the pony. Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: [mockingly] <i>Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail.</i> Hmph, yeah, right. This is another prank, isn't it? I'm going this way.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Wait. The poster is this--
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Whoa whaa waah waah waaaaah [groan]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Uh, Gilda? You pinned the tail on the wrong end.
</dd><dd>[ponies laugh]
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: [roar] <i>This</i> is your idea of a good time?
I've never met a lamer bunch of dweebs in all my life. And Pinkie Pie,
you! You are queen lame-o with your weak little party pranks. Did you
really think you could make me lose my cool? Well, Dash and I have ten
times as much cool as the rest of you put together. Come on Dash, we're
bailing on this pathetic scene. <i>Come on</i> Rainbow Dash. <i>I said</i>, we're leaving.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You know Gilda, <i>I</i> was the one who set up all those weak pranks at this party.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: [gasp] <i>What</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ooh.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: So I guess <i>I'm</i> queen lame-o.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Come on, Dash, you're joshing me.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: They weren't all meant for you specifically, it was just dumb luck that you set them all off.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I shoulda known, that dribble cup had Rainbow Dash written all over it.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: No way. It was Pinkie Pie. She set up this party to trip me up, to make a fool of me.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Me? I threw this party to improve your attitude. I thought a good party might turn that frown upside down.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: And you sure didn't need any help making a fool of yourself. You know, this is not how I thought my <i>old</i> friends would treat my <i>new</i> friends. If being cool is all you care about, maybe you should go find some new <i>cool</i> friends someplace else.
</dd><dd><b>Gilda</b>: Rrgh. Yeah? Well you, you, you are such a, a
flip-flop: cool one minute and lame the next. When you decide not to be
lame anymore, gimme a call. [bird of prey shriek]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: <i>Not</i> cool.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Wow, talk about a party pooper.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Wow, what was that about?
</dd><dd>[ponies talking indistinctly]
</dd><dd><b>Merry May</b>: Um, what just happened?
</dd><dd><b>Pony</b>: Really awkward.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'm sorry everypony, for bringing Gilda
here. I didn't know how rude she was. And Pinkie Pie, I'm really sorry
she ruined that awesome party you put on for her.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hey, if you want to hang out with party poopers, that's your business.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'd rather hang out with you. No hard feelings?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No hard feelings.
</dd><dd>[laughter]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hey Pinkie. Sorry I accused you of misjudging Gilda. Looks like I'm the one who misjudged you.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: It's okay Twilight, even you can't be a
super smart smarty smart-pants all the time. Come on everypony, there's
still a whole lotta party to finish.

like wants to spend time with somepony who's not so nice. Though it's
impossible to control who your friends hang out with, it is possible to
