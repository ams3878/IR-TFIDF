<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sighs] I've been planning this retreat for weeks, and we're already ten minutes behind! Where is that photographer?!
</dd><dd><b>Photographer</b>: ...No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
</dd><dd>[doors open]
</dd><dd><b>Photographer</b>: I'm so sorry! Can you forgive me? I don't expect you to forgive me... Forgive me?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [groans]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Of course. I'll help you set up your—
</dd><dd><b>Photographer</b>: Princess Twilight, thanks so much for
this! The Canterlot Historical Society is thrilled to document the
friendship work your teachers do! Let me just pretty you all up!
</dd><dd>[poink!]
</dd><dd><b>Photographer</b>: Ooh!
</dd><dd>[poink!]
</dd><dd>[poink!]
</dd><dd><b>Photographer</b>: [giggles] Ooh!
</dd><dd>[poink!]
</dd><dd>[poink!]
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ow! Hey!
</dd><dd><b>Photographer</b>: Don't want a single hair out of place, do we? This is for the history books! Now...
</dd><dd>[camera flashing]
</dd><dd><b>Photographer</b>: Well, that's that! Bye!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Waaaait! You forgot Starlight! She needs a picture, too!
</dd><dd><b>Photographer</b>: 'Kay.
</dd><dd>[camera flashing]
</dd><dd><b>Photographer</b>: Now I'll get out of your manes. I know how busy you are.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[ominous music]
</dd><dd><b>Photographer</b>: Now I have everything I need.

<dl><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Yes, I know! We <i>have</i> been
planning this for quite some time. [laughing evilly] Oh, thank you,
Applejack. My spell can create a copy of anypony I desire. All I need is
 an image and a piece of the pony. [sniffs] Oh, and this.
</dd><dd>[magic zap]
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Why copies, Rarity? Because Princess
Twilight and her friends control the Elements of Harmony, the most
powerful weapon in all Equestria.
</dd><dd>[magic zap]
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Which means you - will - be - able - to - use - them - too!
</dd><dd>[magic zap]
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: And serve me!
</dd><dd>[magic zap]
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Together, we will destroy Twilight Sparkle and her meddlesome friends!
</dd><dd>[magic zap]
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Of course I haven't forgotten Starlight
 Glimmer! She stole my hive. Turned my subjects against me! So I'll take
 her friends away while she watches! And then, I'll destroy her!
[maniacal laughter]
</dd><dd>[magic zap]
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: With the Elements under my control,
I'll build a new hive of Earth ponies, unicorns, and Pegasi, and I will
rule as Queen once again!

<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hmm. At least our retreat isn't <i>too</i> far behind schedule. Get ready for fun!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Are we talking <i>fun</i> fun, or learning pretending to be fun?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Both! We've all been so busy teaching,
 we've hardly had a chance to hang out with each other. And I may have
scheduled some friendship activities as well!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Count me in! We can do friendship trust falls and pony pyramids! Oh! And hide and seek! Quick! Find me!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Well, I love the idea of some quiet time with my best friends.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [screams] You found me!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Rarity, why is Applejack carrying all your stuff?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Oh, that's not mine. Yes, I <i>used</i> to overpack a tad, but now it's just the essentials for me. I'm a simple filly.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Normally I wouldn't lug so much gear, but did y'all know this is Starlight's first time campin'?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I just never really felt the need to... "hang out" in nature.
</dd><dd>[insects buzzing]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Home has books, tea, fewer bugs, a roof...
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: That attitude right there is why I brought
the whole kit and caboodle. I'm givin' Starlight the full Apple family
campin' experience!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, where <i>are</i> we camping?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Right next to the Elements that brought us all together in the first place – the Tree of Harmony!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Listen to your queen! We must retrieve the Elements of Harmony!
</dd><dd><b>Mean Pinkie Pie</b>: Hunting down some lame Elements? This is the worst day ever!
</dd><dd><b>Mean Fluttershy</b>: No. <i>Now</i> it's the worst day ever! [laughing cruelly]
</dd><dd><b>Mean Rarity</b>: Those Elements are mine! Along with this rock! Oh, and that twig!
</dd><dd><b>Mean Applejack</b>: I got all <i>kinds</i> o' Elements right here under my hat. I'll let you see 'em for five bits.
</dd><dd><b>Mean Rainbow Dash</b>: [scoffs] Losers.
</dd><dd><b>Mean Twilight Sparkle</b>: Why didn't you just attack them?
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Excuse me?
</dd><dd><b>Mean Twilight Sparkle</b>: You were close enough to pull hairs from their manes. Why not just take your revenge then?
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: They've defeated my army. I know better than to strike alone. I need—
</dd><dd><b>Mean Twilight Sparkle</b>: Friends?
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: <i>Servants!</i> And the power of the Elements!
</dd><dd><b>Mean Twilight Sparkle</b>: Right. So where <i>are</i> these Elements of Harmony?
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: The location of the most powerful
weapon in Equestria isn't something made known to just anypony. I
learned they were hidden somewhere in this forest.
</dd><dd><b>Mean Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah, well, it is a <i>big</i> forest.
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: [growling]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Everypony, stop! And smell these roses! [sniffs] Ahhh! Oh, yeah!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [nervous giggle] Right. Roses. Fun. Now, let’s try and stay on schedule.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Applejack, darling, anything in that wagon for mane maintenance?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh, let's see here. Uh... all right. I got a bandana!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Ugh, an entire wagon and no anti-frizz? Darling, you're not even prepared.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I am! For campin'? How ya doin', Starlight?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Whoa! Ugh. [flatly] Great.
</dd><dd><b>Bird 1</b>: [tweeting]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, no! You and your sister fell out of your
 nest and got separated? That's terrible! Here. I'm sure your home isn't
 too far away.
</dd><dd>[swing creaking]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [yelps] Pinkie! If we keep stopping to have fun, we're never gonna get to the fun things <i>I've</i> got planned!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] Good point! Last one to the Tree of Harmony is a parasprite! Whoo-hoo!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sighs]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Mean Pinkie Pie</b>: I'm sooooo bored. Are we there yet?
</dd><dd><b>Mean Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Where</i> yet? We don't even know where we're going!
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: The quicker we search the forest, the quicker we find the Elements.
</dd><dd><b>Mean Applejack</b>: <i>I</i> know where the Elements are. This, uh, here boulder just told me. I swear.
</dd><dd><b>Bird 2</b>: [tweeting]
</dd><dd><b>Mean Fluttershy</b>: You tried to fly out of the nest, but you fell and got lost?
</dd><dd><b>Bird 2</b>: [tweeting]
</dd><dd><b>Mean Fluttershy</b>: [laughing cruelly] Hope you like walking! [laughing cruelly]
</dd><dd><b>Mean Rainbow Dash</b>: [yawns] Come get me when I should care.
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Where... are... the others?!
</dd><dd><b>Mean Applejack</b>: Uh... A, uh, a bugbear in... plaid socks
 flew down and, uh, g-grabbed them! Then disappeared! Huh. Craziest
thing I ever did see!
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Turn around. We're going back.
</dd><dd><b>Mean Twilight Sparkle</b>: No. Keep searching. I'll find the others. We can accomplish more if we split our resources.
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Very well. You have my permission.
</dd><dd><b>Mean Twilight Sparkle</b>: "Permission"? You need us way more than we need you, <i>your Majesty</i>! The others are fools. But with me to lead them, there's no reason we can't find the Elements and keep the power for ourselves!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[rustling]
</dd><dd><b>Mean Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You're it! Hey, how'd you get ahead of me? You're fast.
</dd><dd><b>Mean Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ugh! I'm looking for Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Aren't they back there?
</dd><dd><b>Mean Twilight Sparkle</b>: They are?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Sure! Unless they're already at the Tree of Harmony.
</dd><dd><b>Mean Twilight Sparkle</b>: What is the <i>Tree</i> of Harmony?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh-ho-ho. This is one of your "activities",
right? Like a friendship quiz? It's the crystal tree that holds the
Elements of Harmony. Boom!
</dd><dd><b>Mean Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps] Where is it?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [imitates buzzer] It's at the bottom of the stairs in the ravine by the Castle of the Two Sisters. Double boom!
</dd><dd><b>Mean Twilight Sparkle</b>: How do you know? You've seen it?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Mm-hmm. Honestly, Twilight, these questions are super easy.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Bird 1</b>: [tweeting]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Right where you belong.
</dd><dd><b>Bird 1</b>: [tweets]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, dear. This isn't where <i>I</i> belong. Oh, Rainbow Dash! I'm so glad you're here. I was lost.
</dd><dd><b>Mean Rainbow Dash</b>: Bummer. Later.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: What just happened?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>, <b>Rarity</b>, <b>Rainbow Dash</b>, and <b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [overlapping] Fluttershy!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, fantastic. First Pinkie races ahead of us, and now Fluttershy's lost somewhere behind us. My retreat is off to a <i>great</i> start!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: It's not like Fluttershy to disappear like this.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: We'll split up and search for her. We can all meet back at the Tree. Starlight, take the navigation gear and—
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [quickly] Go with Rarity? Great! Rainbow Dash, you can go with Applejack! [chuckles]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'll find Pinkie Pie.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Mean Pinkie Pie</b>: Bored. Bored. Bored.
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: This is ridiculous! Where are my other minions?!
</dd><dd><b>Mean Rarity</b>: Probably plotting to steal <i>my</i> things! [growls]
</dd><dd><b>Mean Applejack</b>: They're at a secret party up in that
there tree. Run by a... squirrel named, uh, Jerome. But, uh, y-you need a
 password to get in.
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: [growls] Enough!
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd>[slam!]
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: You will go out there and find the
others, you will bring them back here, and we will steal the Elements of
 Harmony so I can destroy Starlight's life like she destroyed mine!
[through gritted teeth] <i>Understand?</i>
</dd><dd><b>Mean Rarity</b>, <b>Mean Applejack</b>, and <b>Mean Pinkie Pie</b>: [nervously] Uh-huh!
</dd><dd><b>Mean Applejack</b>: The party password is "rutabaga".
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: [eye twitches]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Mean Fluttershy</b>: [mockingly] Why don't you fly up to your nest? Oh, that's right. You can't! [laughing cruelly]
</dd><dd><b>Bird 1</b>: [tweeting]
</dd><dd><b>Mean Fluttershy</b>: Oh. Nopony asked <i>you</i>. I hope you all <i>freeze</i> this winter!
</dd><dd>[mice squeaking]
</dd><dd><b>Mean Fluttershy</b>: [laughing cruelly]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Hello again, little friend. I think I may be walking in circles.
</dd><dd><b>Bird 1</b>: [tweeting angrily]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [gasps] Oh, my! Where did you learn that kind of language? Um, excuse me?
</dd><dd>[animals growling and chittering angrily]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [whimpering]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Mean Rarity</b>: Finally, you found her!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Me? We're looking for Fluttershy!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Where's Starlight?
</dd><dd><b>Mean Rarity</b>: Well, if I knew that—
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [grunts] Hey!
</dd><dd><b>Mean Rarity</b>: This is mine! And this as well! Oh, and this is <i>absolutely</i> mine!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Rarity, what in the hay are <i>you</i> gonna do with a fishin' rod?
</dd><dd><b>Mean Rarity</b>: I don't know. But I <i>wants</i> it! [snorts]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Starlight, darling, you're a gloriously bad camper. And coming from me, that is saying a lot.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I know. Want to break it to Applejack for me?
</dd><dd>[rustle]
</dd><dd><b>Mean Applejack</b>: Who's breakin' what now?
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Mean Applejack</b>: Who are <i>you</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Very funny, Applejack. Still me under all this gear. Starlight.
</dd><dd><b>Mean Applejack</b>: Starlight? How 'bout that? Y'all better come with me. It's, uh, dangerous out here.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Applejack, darling, are you all right? You look a little peaky. And where's your wagon?
</dd><dd><b>Mean Applejack</b>: Uh... stolen! Uh, I barely got away! Follow me, and I'll tell ya all about it.
</dd><dd>[clattering]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie! There you are! What are you doing?
</dd><dd>[bubbling]
</dd><dd>[pop!]
</dd><dd><b>Mean Pinkie Pie</b>: You call that a pop?! Ugh!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I thought you were racing to the retreat.
</dd><dd><b>Mean Pinkie Pie</b>: Please. Why would I waste my time on a boring, lame, no-fun retreat?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What? Rainbow Dash! I think something's wrong with Pinkie!
</dd><dd><b>Mean Rainbow Dash</b>: Not my problem.
</dd><dd>[splash!]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [groans]
</dd><dd>[bubbling]
</dd><dd>[pop!]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: And then we all grew super-long manes with
all kinds of colors, and your castle grew out of the ground, and
everypony was like, "Whoa!" And then we sang this song about rainbows,
and— [gasps]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [crying]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Fluttershy! What's wrong?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [crying] Everycreature is mad at me!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] What?! That can't be right!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [crying, sniffling]
</dd><dd><b>Mean Twilight Sparkle</b>: [groans] Can we hurry this up? We're on a schedule here!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Twilight, your schedule can wait! Fluttershy's upset.
</dd><dd><b>Mean Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, tell her to get over it! I'll go get the others. Stay here!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [crying, sniffling]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, great. You upset Fluttershy, too?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You know what, Twilight? Maybe if you weren't so worried about schedules, you'd realize <i>you're</i> the one ruining the retreat for your friends!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps] Well, if my friends don't care about the retreat I planned for them... maybe they should've stayed home!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: <i>Can't we all just get along?!</i> [crying]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Mean Twilight Sparkle</b>: Keep it together. You can do this. You need those imbeciles if your plan is gonna come together.
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: <i>Your</i> plan?
</dd><dd><b>Mean Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps] Uh, <i>the</i> plan. I'm just trying to do your bidding, your Majesty.
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Grub-sitting you six is nothing like
controlling my hive! Give me one good reason why I shouldn't just
destroy you all and start over!
</dd><dd><b>Mean Twilight Sparkle</b>: Because I know where the Elements of Harmony are. You need me.
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: [maniacal laughter]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Mean Rarity</b>: <i>Mine</i>. Mine! [crazed laughter] All mine!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [to Applejack] I'm guessing some kind of curse? Maybe poison joke?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Well, somethin' sure ain't right.
</dd><dd><b>Mean Rarity</b>: What are you plotting back there? I can
hear you, you know! Don't think you're going to steal my things!
[panting, spluttering]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hang on. I got a shovel we can use to whack those vines out of the way.
</dd><dd><b>Mean Rarity</b>: [grunting] <i>I knew it!</i> I knew you wanted it all for yourselves! You can't have it!
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Mean Rarity</b>: It's mine, you hear me?! All <i>mi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hine!</i> [crazed laughter]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Mean Applejack</b>: ...So there I was. Just me and, uh, a
bucket of honey. Yeah, yeah, that's the ticket. Uh, b-but I-I survived
all by myself in this here forest for, uh, a hundred and... twenty-seven
 hours!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Really? I can't believe you've never told us that story before.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: She's making a point. We get it. You're the greatest camper in the history of Equestria.
</dd><dd><b>Mean Applejack</b>: Well, I sure don't need any o' that silly stuff <i>you're</i> luggin' around.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Uh, the things <i>you</i> gave me are silly?!
</dd><dd><b>Mean Applejack</b>: [chuckles] Just look in a mirror. Guess I should've told you that before, huh? [chuckling]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [gasps, tearing up] Glad I was so entertaining for you!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [to Mean Applejack] I'm going to make sure that
she doesn't break a hoof out there, and then you and I are going to have
 a serious talk!
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Finally! There. That's all of you. Nopony leaves without my say-so.
</dd><dd><b>Mean Applejack</b>: Now, wait a second. Weren't you just—?
</dd><dd>[magic zap]
</dd><dd><b>Mean Applejack</b>: [gulps]
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: The time for my revenge on Starlight
Glimmer has come! Let's see if you're telling the truth about this Tree.
 [maniacal laughter]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Starlight! Oh! Please stop running!
</dd><dd>[screech]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: [yelps]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Ugh!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b> and <b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Whoa!
</dd><dd>[crash!]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: [crying]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Of course I care about Fluttershy!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Then you've got a super weird way of showing it!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: W-What in Equestria's going on here?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Twilight is so into her <i>retreat</i> that she doesn't even care if her friends are upset! She just wants us to "stay on schedule"!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, I'm sorry, Pinkie! If I knew you
 thought this was a "boring, lame, no-fun retreat", I wouldn't have
invited you in the first place!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>I never said that!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Sorry, y'all. We would've been here sooner, but we had to take the long way after Rarity ran off with all my stuff.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Wha—?! I most certainly did not!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: What?! You know I ain't no liar! [to Starlight Glimmer] Where's all your gear?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Why? So you can laugh at me some more?!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hey, hey, we're all friends here!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: <i>Friends?!</i> You left me alone in the woods! [crying]
</dd><dd>[main cast except Twilight arguing]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Everypony, quiet! Listen. We know each
 other really well — the great stuff and how to get on each other's
nerves, too. I wanted a fun trip with my friends. But instead, I got
carried away with plans and ruined everything. If you want to forget it
all and head home, I won't be offended. I just want us to stop fighting.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: [to Starlight Glimmer] Hey, sorry if I got carried away with all that campin' stuff.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I'm sorry, too. I should've just told you I'll never like camping. Also, I'll never like camping.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, if we're all being honest, I can't survive with just this tiny yet fashionable little saddlebag! I miss my things!
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [to Twilight Sparkle] I'm sorry that you thought that I thought your plan was lame. Your plans are the most un-lamest!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: And I always have fun when we're all together. Even if it's learning pretending to be fun.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: So... does that mean you still want to have the retreat?
</dd><dd><b>All except Twilight Sparkle and Fluttershy</b>: Yes!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: If everypony likes me again.
</dd><dd><b>All</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Let's get to that Tree. I have the whole campsite set up and ready.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Mean Pinkie Pie</b>: [groans] What's this garbage?
</dd><dd><b>Mean Applejack</b>: Badger installation art! Ya see—
</dd><dd><b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: <i>Just! Retrieve! The Elements!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Mean Fluttershy</b>: [laughing cruelly]
</dd><dd><b>Mean Rarity</b>: Mine! Mine!
</dd><dd>[clattering]
</dd><dd><b>Mean Rarity</b>: Mine! [crazed laughter]
</dd><dd><b>Mean Twilight Sparkle</b>: Once we get the power of the
Elements, no creature – not even her Majesty – can tell us what to do.
Just follow my lead. Got it?
</dd><dd><b>Mean Ponies</b>: [laughing evilly]
</dd><dd><b>Mean Rarity</b>: Ooh! That one's mine!
</dd><dd>[ping!]
</dd><dd><b>Mean Rarity</b>: [crazed laughter]
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Mean Fluttershy</b>: Oops. I'd say sorry, but I'm not!
</dd><dd><b>Mean Rarity</b> and <b>Mean Fluttershy</b>: [grunting]
</dd><dd><b>Mean Twilight Sparkle</b>: Stop it, fools!
</dd><dd>[ping!]
</dd><dd><b>Mean Twilight Sparkle</b>: We need the Elements to take out Chrysalis! [gasps]

</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [laughing] This was... the worst... day... ever!
</dd><dd><b>All</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Come on, everypony. We can fix this campsite in no time.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Spoken like a true camper.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Eh, don't push it.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b> and <b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [chuckling]

world can throw at us.
