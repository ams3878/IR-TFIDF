</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: No! Teacup!

</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: No! <i>Teacup!</i>
</dd><dd>[magic zap]
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: [screeching] <i>No</i>! [normally] Oh, Starlight! I can't put a trick that's not working into my act! How come it's not working?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: It could be because you're just yelling "teacup!" and not picturing it in your mind.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Oh. Yeah, that could be it.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What does your teacup look like? What shape is it? What color?
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: [inhales]
</dd><dd>[magic zaps]
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Whoo! Starlight, I did it!
</dd><dd>[splurt]
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! I did it, I did it, I did it! Woo-hoo-hoo!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Hey!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Teacup! [giggles] Teacup! Teacup, teacup, teacup! Tea-cup! Teacup, teacup, tea-cup! You know what you need? A teacup!

</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [groans]
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Whoops! I guess I pictured a teacup poodle? Heh.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Trixie! You ruined my teacakes!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: I just got excited! This is the first time I did a transfiguration spell! <i>Real</i> magic! Come on! Be impressed by me! [as Starlight Glimmer] "Yay, Trixie! You're so great at magic and having good hair!"
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [chuckles] Good job, Trix. But I was
baking these to give to Twilight and the girls for their friendship
retreat. Pinkie Pie gave me a recipe and everything.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Oh! You need some snacks to give to Twilight? I've got you covered. [humming to herself]
</dd><dd>[splat]
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Problem solved.
</dd><dd>[magic rumbling]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [exhales] Not exactly.

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I am so excited for this friendship
retreat! I can't remember the last time we all got to hang out without
having to save Equestria.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, we <i>are</i> awesome. But technically, we weren't the last ponies to save Equestria.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I was speaking in a broader sense. Are you sure you don't want to come with us?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Yeah, I have three new comics to get through.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: And I promised Trixie we'd practice more magic. It might be better if the castle was empty, if you know what I mean.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: [groans] Relax. If anything breaks, Starlight will just go back in time and fix it!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [nervous laughter]
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Kidding.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: We'll take good care of the castle while you're gone.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Have fun on your friendship retreat! [hushed, to Starlight] What in Equestria <i>is</i> a friendship retreat, anyway?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [hushed] They're gonna bond, share laughs, and if I know them, they're gonna sing a song.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: [giggles] We are gonna have so much more fun than them!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [giggles] Shhh!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Twilight, wait! Starlight has something for you!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Huh?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [nervously] Here, I, um, brought you snacks...
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, how... thoughtful, thanks. We will... not get hungry on the train.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: It was supposed to be teacakes, but... [sighs] it's a long story. Have a great time!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You, too!
</dd><dd>[door shuts]
</dd><dd>[train rattling]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Okay, Trixie, what kinds of spells did you want to work on next?
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Well, every self-respecting magician has a disappearing act, so maybe we could start with that?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Hmmm. Nothing just disappears, so
that's technically a teleportation spell, and those are pretty hard.
Maybe we should start with something smaller.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: No-no-no-no. The Great and Powerful Trrrrrixie goes big or not at all! Just tell me how you do it.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Well, I've always found magic is tied
 to my emotions. Whatever I'm feeling fuels whatever I'm doing, and the
stronger I'm feeling, the stronger the magic.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Right. Like when you were so upset that cutie
marks took away your friend, your magic was strong enough to enslave an
entire village.
</dd><dd>[magic warbling]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Yep. Thanks for bringing that up.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: See? I'm already learning. If anypony is gonna teach me how to do a disappearing spell—
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Teleportation spell.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Whatever. I'm complimenting you. And me. We can do this, 'cause we're amazing, and magic is friendship and stuff.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [laughs] I guess we can give it a whirl. Now, we just need to find you something to teleport.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Spike! How about it?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [nervous laugh]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Uh, let's pick something, I don't know, not living?
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: I mean it won't be as impressive, but okay. Teach away, mini-Twilight.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [groans]

<dl><dd><b>"Ginger Locks"</b>: [bored] Welcome to Manehattan Escapes.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Ooh, I'm going to start with a facial, and then get my hooves done, and—
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, it's not <i>that</i> kind of retreat.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Isn't it called "Manehattan Escapes" because it's a deluxe spa where you can escape all of your troubles?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Nope! It's because we get locked in a room and we have to solve puzzles and riddles in order to escape!
</dd><dd><b>"Ginger Locks"</b>: [bored] The clues will lead you to a key to get out.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Team-building!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>, <b>Pinkie Pie</b>, <b>Rainbow Dash</b> and <b>Rarity</b>: [sighs]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Come on, girls. This could be fun.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Could be? Some of the brightest minds in Equestria put together these puzzles!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I'm just happy to be with all of you.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Me, too! I'm not great at solving riddles,
but I'm super great at cheering other ponies on while they do it! Go,
us! Ooo, ooo! Woo-hoo!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Yes, yes, woo-hoo. [clears throat] But just so we know, exactly how long will we be locked in here?
</dd><dd><b>"Ginger Locks"</b>: [bored] A group of griffons set the record for the fastest escape. It only took them an hour.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hah! Griffons barely like each other!
We're basically the poster ponies for amazing friendships! So get your
quill ready, bub! You're gonna have to write down a new record!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: If you master this spell before the girls get back, you'd be setting some kind of record!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Challenge accepted!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Okay. What you want to do is concentrate on the object that you want to teleport...
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Yeah, I'm gonna go... all the way over here.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Concentrate on teleporting. Got it. Doin' the spell!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: No, Trix, wait, not just—
</dd><dd>[magic zap]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [groans]
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: [weakly] Ta-da.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [hyperventilating] No-no-no-no-no-no-no! You made Twilight's friendship map disappear!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: [clears throat] Teleport.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Really?!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Well, it was behind the apple. It was bound to
happen. On the plus side, my magic is getting better! I made a whole
table go poof! That was pretty impressive!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Trixie, we <i>have</i> to get that map back.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: We'll find it. No big deal.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Twilight's never gonna trust me to be alone in this castle again! What were you thinking?!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Teleport, like you told me to.
</dd><dd>[magic warbling]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: No! You're supposed to concentrate on the object, not just teleporting!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: [scoffs] Well, gee, you probably should have told me all the steps before you let me do the spell.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I tried. [gasps] I... need a minute.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[dishes clattering]
</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd>[crockery shattering]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Hey, are you okay?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I will be once I cast a spell to contain my anger in this bottle.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Wait, what?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Do you see this storm cloud? This has never happened before! All this magical energy has to go <i>somewhere</i>, and if I'm not using it to fight a magical duel or bend my friends' wills to obey my every command...
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Hah. I remember that.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: The point is, I don't know what my
magic's going to do. So I'm hoping if I bottle up my anger, I won't do
who-knows-what to Trixie.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Are you sure that's a good idea?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What choice do I have? I've got to
get that map back, and I don't wanna lose Trixie. If she knew what I was
 thinking right now, she'd probably never talk to me again.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Okay... You do what you need to do. I'll see if I can find the map somewhere in the castle.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Trixie!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Oh, <i>there</i> you are! For a minute, I didn't
 think you were coming back, and that you might be upset with me for
some weird reason. But then I remembered – you never get mad at me.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [groans]
</dd><dd>[magic warbling]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [exhales] Nope! [laughs nervously]
Not mad at all! So, the map is probably in the last place you were
thinking of. Where was that?
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Ooh, great question. I wish you'd asked it, like, right after I did the spell. I don't remember anymore.
</dd><dd>[magic warbling]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [groans] No worries. We'll just take a walk around town. Maybe that'll jog your memory.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Okay, that sounds fun. Ooh!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Did you remember?
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Nope! But I did think we could stop for cinnamon nuts while we're out!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Cinnamon... nuts?
</dd><dd>[magic warbling]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: That's a good idea!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Yes! I've been craving something sweet since I couldn't have any teacakes this morning.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [exhales] You got this, Starlight...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Woo-hoo! Go, Twilight! you can do it!
</dd><dd>[click, rattling]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Woo-hoo!
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Hoo-wee! You solved that triangley thing mighty fast! Uh, does anypony need a purple jewel?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Ooh! Plum or boysenberry?
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Don't both those fruits mean purple?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Yes, but one's a lovely purple and one's... well, icky.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [groans] Just put the gem in! We're trying to set a record here!
</dd><dd>[clunking]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [cheer-singing] Yay! We solved another clue, 'cause our friendship is so true! Yaaaay, us! Woo-hoo!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Trixie</b>: [chewing]
</dd><dd><b>"Clarity Cut"</b>: Ah, hello, fillies. Uh, how can I help you? Oh, are those cinnamon nuts?
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Mmm, yes. I got them from the cart outside. They're delicious. Do you want some?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Have you seen a big table? Magical map on it, sometimes glowing cutie marks shoot out?
</dd><dd><b>"Clarity Cut"</b>: [stuttering] A big ta— Uh, no! Uh, why in Equestria would something like that be in here? Ha.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Well, I cast a pretty amazing spell that
transported it to the last place I was thinking of, but I might have
been thinking about how I'd treat myself to a nice brooch instead.
</dd><dd><b>"Clarity Cut"</b>: Ah, well, no huge table here. Uh, are you still interested in that brooch?
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Sure!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: No! We don't have time for this! Twilight and the girls are gonna be back soon!
</dd><dd>[magic warbling]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: But I'm not upset. What's our next stop?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Nope, I ain't seen it.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Are you sure? It's really, really important that we find it. And it might be here because <i>somepony</i>...
</dd><dd>[magic warbling]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: ...was craving apples.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: I'm still craving them. They'd go so well with cinnamon nuts!
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: [sniffs] Oh, them nuts sure do smell good! Heh-heh.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Granny Smith, <i>please</i>. The table?
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: [confused muttering] Well, my eyes ain't
what they used to be, but I'd know for sure if a big ol' table done
appeared out of thin air.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [sighs]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[teapot poodle yapping]
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Darn. I could've sworn it'd be at the ice cream
parlor, because it was warm in the castle and I thought I wanted ice
cream, and— Ooh! Maybe we should check out the Crystal Empire, 'cause
Twilight's castle is made out of crystals, so I totally had crystals on
my mind.
</dd><dd>[magic warbling]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [tired] Okay, we better start moving if we want to make it to the Crystal Empire.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Are you okay, Starlight? Because you seem a little, uh, what's the word... "lch-bh-ba".
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [groans]
</dd><dd>[magic warbling]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [tired] Nope. I am great.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Did your saddlebag just glow?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [weakly] No.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Gimme!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [weakly] No!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Give it here!
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [weakly] Don't!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: What's in this?
</dd><dd><b>Bulk Biceps</b>: Cinnamon nuts!
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Ooh, I have had a hankerin' for these all day!
</dd><dd><b>"Clarity Cut"</b>: Uh, me, too! Ever since that Trixie came by with 'em.

</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: You ruined my teacakes!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: What?! [anxious noises]
</dd><dd><b>"Clarity Cut"</b>: You just had to give Twilight those smelly pretzels!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Were they <i>your</i> pretzels? I don't understand.
</dd><dd><b>Bulk Biceps</b>: You don't pay attention when I'm trying to teach you!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Starlight, can you help me, please?!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Uh, Twilight, can you help me, please?

</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I've got the key!

</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'm not. I knew we were the best!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: You're the worst!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: That seems harsh.
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Hiyaaa!
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Whoa! <i>Starlight!</i> [panting] I don't know what's happening! Starlight, help!
</dd><dd>[magic fizzling]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I'm glad Twilight isn't here to see this.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I wish that Starlight was here to see
how strong friendships can be when we trust each other and work
together! You've all taught me so much.

</dd><dd>[magic warbling and rumbling]
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: You are?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [sighs] I'm really... mad at you. You
 lost Twilight's map table. You make jokes like it's no big deal. It's
like you don't even care you could get me in a lot of trouble. If we
can't find that table, Twilight's <i>never</i> going to trust me again, and the worst part is <i>you didn't even say you were sorry!</i>
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: I... I-I'm sorry. I had no idea you felt that way.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Yeah! I do! [sighs] But to be fair, I
 don't know how you could have known. I did a spell and bottled up my
anger, but when the bottle broke, it infected these three. I'm really
sorry. I used magic so I wouldn't use magic. I should have guessed that
would backfire.
</dd><dd><b>"Clarity Cut"</b>: Aw, that's all right. It was a slow day.
</dd><dd><b>Granny Smith</b>: Yeah, I was gonna get my dentures cleaned before y'all showed up.
</dd><dd><b>Bulk Biceps</b>: Ah! Oh, no! My nut cart!
</dd><dd>[magic humming]
</dd><dd><b>Bulk Biceps</b>: Yay! My nut cart!
</dd><dd><b>"Clarity Cut"</b>: Uh, hang on. Don't you work at the spa?
</dd><dd><b>Bulk Biceps</b>: [gasps] I'm late for my other job! What? I wear many hats.
</dd><dd>[cart squeaking]
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Not gonna lie. Hearing you and those random
ponies say all those terrible things about me wasn't easy. But I needed
to hear it. Why didn't you just tell me how you felt?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I didn't want to lose you as a friend.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Pfft! Come on! It'd take a lot more than that to lose me. Our friendship is stronger than a few angry words.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: And a magical temper tantrum?
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Listen, I'd take that over the boring pony you
were becoming any day. The Starlight I love is passionate, lively, and
yeah, sometimes angry. Those are my favorite parts of you. That and the
fact that you forgive me every time.
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [giggles] I'll forgive you if you forgive me.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: Deal. [gasps] I remembered what I was thinking about!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[bell rings]
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: You're kidding me.
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: There's more to it than that. I was thinking
about how glad I am to have met you, and I remembered our first meeting –
 here at the Ponyville spa. And now I just have to teleport it back!

</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b> and <b>Trixie</b>: [simultaneously] Nothing!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: ...What?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Let's just say I learned a friendship lesson while you were gone.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You've barely graduated, and you're already taking initiative! [tearing up] Oh... So proud...
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: We learned about team building and problem solving...
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: And when not to sing songs!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: We certainly had a good time, but I <i>really</i> was looking forward to a spa day, and the Ponyville spa's still open. Anyone?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Sounds good to me!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [simultaneously] I have a coupon!
</dd><dd><b>Rest of main cast</b>: [simultaneous agreement]
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: We'll meet you there! [to Starlight] Quick! Do
you have a spell that will make the spa ponies forget that the map table
 was there?
</dd><dd><b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Haven't you learned anything about using magic to solve your problems?
</dd><dd><b>Trixie</b>: No. If we learned that lesson, how will we ever have fun?
