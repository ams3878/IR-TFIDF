<dl><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: I can't believe we're goin' to the Appleloosa County Fair!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Animal shows, carnival rides...
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: And all kinds of food on a stick! [slurps]
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Speaking of food, did you pack snacks for the train?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: For there and back.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: And our train tickets are all set.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: And I've got our whole itinerary planned!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Are you sure you're not Twilight's sister?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b> and <b>Scootaloo</b>: [laugh]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Weeks of planning has all come down to this. All we have to do now is wait for our chaperone to get here.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b> and <b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Mm-hmm!
</dd><dd>[pause]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: So when's Rainbow Dash comin'?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I thought you were gonna ask Applejack.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: [to Sweetie Belle] I don't suppose you asked Rarity?
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: You mean we spent all this time planning a trip, and none of us asked anypony to take us?!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: In our defense, every other part of the trip was planned really well.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: We really did think of everything except finding somepony to take us, and the fair is only today!
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I'm sorry, darlings, but I can't possibly go to
Appleloosa. I promised to deliver a new design to Fancy Pants for his
Monocle and Top Hat Appreciation Society soiree.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Can't you finish it tomorrow?
</dd><dd>[smack!]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Well, I could. But you'll learn as you get older
 how important it is to keep your promises, especially when running a
business.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Maybe we should just go by ourselves?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: What?! Oh, my dear, no! Appleloosa is far too
long a train ride for young foals without accompaniment. You could end
up in the wrong place entirely. Why don't you see if Rainbow Dash is
free?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Sorry, but I just heard from Spitfire that a
 whole bunch of storm clouds got loose from the cloud factory, and she
needs every Wonderbolt to help bust 'em.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Aw, come on, Rainbow Dash! They won't miss
one pony! And we really want to go to the fair! Apparently we're too
young to go alone.
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, duh. Young ponies like you could get
 lost and never find your way back. But I still can't go. Being a
Wonderbolt isn't just about showing off. It's also a responsibility.
You'll understand when you get older. I'm sure you'll find somepony else
 to take you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Applejack</b>: I wish I could, sugarcube. But Big Mac's not feelin' well today.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Awww. But Big Mac's old enough to take care of himself, and we'd all have so much fun together.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Sometimes takin' care of somepony is more
important than havin' fun. Speakin' of which, don't you even think about
 tryin' to go without a grown pony there to take care of you. You could
end up in hot water or worse.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: We know.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: The fair could be over before we find somepony to take us.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: But then we thought of you, since the fair will be full of all sorts of animals and creatures.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I'm sorry, but Twilight has an important magical research project, and she's asked for my help.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I guess that means Twilight's busy, too?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm afraid I am. Star Swirl sent me
this enchanted flower, and it isn't doing well. If I figure out its
magical properties, maybe we can save it.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: So that's a "no" on going with us to the fair?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: We've already asked Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity, and none of them can come.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: And everypony made it clear we're too young to go on our own.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, definitely. You could take the wrong train or miss your stop...
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Or get lost in a strange town and end up in a dangerous situation with nopony to help you.
</dd><dd><b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: We know!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I know it's hard, but sometimes you just can't do what you want.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I'm pretty sure if <i>you</i> wanted to go to the fair, you could.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Sure, grown-ups can do a lot of things
 that foals can't. But there's plenty we can't do either. Like right
now, I can't find a single reference to this flower!
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: None of the birds or insects I've talked to have heard of it either.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I wonder if there's anything in Shadetail Evergreen's <i>Tome of Flora and Fauna</i>?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: That book's pretty out of date, but it might be worth a try.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I think there's a copy in the library
filed under "Discontinued But Still Potentially Useful Ancient Texts".
Unless I put it under "Hokum With a Slight Chance of Practical
Applications".
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: I guess this flower is the most interestin' thing we're gonna see today.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Unless you count watching Twilight struggle to remember how she organizes her books.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I bet every pony in Equestria is in Appleloosa right now.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Every pony but us.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I wish we didn't have to wait to grow up.
</dd><dd>[magic sounds]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: I wish it would happen all at once. Then we'd know everything we need to get to the fair and back with no problem.
</dd><dd>[louder magic sounds]
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I just wish we were as old as our sisters. Then nopony could tell us what to do, and we'd be able to take care of ourselves.
</dd><dd>[even louder magic sounds]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Hey, Sweetie Belle, why's your face all lit up?
</dd><dd>[high-pitched humming]

</dd><dd><b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: We can go to the fair! [laugh]

<dl><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: I hope you brought the tickets. We've gotta hurry if we're going to make the train.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I think we'll be fine. Check out how fast we're going! Grown-up legs are strong!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: You're not kidding!
</dd><dd>[rattling]
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: I don't know how much of this my scooter can take!
</dd><dd>[ponies gasp]

now! We can do anything! And all those worries Twilight and the others
had don't apply anymore. Because we're big! And bein' big is all it
takes!

</dd><dd><b>"Loose Tracks"</b>: [laughing]
</dd><dd><b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: [scream]
</dd><dd><b>"Loose Tracks"</b>: Sorry, I don't mean to laugh. But you
three must not travel much. This is Hayseed Junction. The train to
Appleloosa isn't for a few hours. Or you could set off on hoof. It's
treacherous and confusing! Unfit for the young or timid! But you three
are grown-ups. You'll be fine. I'll write down some directions.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Maybe we should wait for the train.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: And miss the fair?!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: We already ended up in the wrong place,
which is exactly what we were warned about. And what if we can't follow
the directions?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Come on. We didn't come all this way for
nothin'. Besides, I've been through a swamp as a young pony. As a
grown-up, it'll be a snap.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Grown-ups always know the way!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Because being big is all it takes!
</dd><dd><b>"Loose Tracks"</b>: [laughs maniacally, hacks, inhales] Sorry. I've got kind of a throat thing.

</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: And we are definitely not lost.
</dd><dd><b>Spur</b>: Okay. But that swamp is pretty confusing if you're not from around here. I'm Spur, and this is Biscuit.

</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: I'm Apple Bloom. Nice to meet you. But, uh, we're not confused. We're just... explorin' new ways to Appleloosa.

</dd><dd><b>Spur</b>: No, it isn't!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Uh, which is it?
</dd><dd><b>Spur</b>: Biscuit thinks he can just take Bloofy here to the fair.
</dd><dd><b>Biscuit</b>: Why not? It's just up the road. And Bloofy's <i>my</i> pet, too.
</dd><dd><b>Spur</b>: Since when?! Bloofy's never even seen a crowd! Which you'd know if you ever took care of him!
</dd><dd><b>Biscuit</b>: Did you ever think meeting all those ponies might be good for him?
</dd><dd><b>Bloofy</b>: [chittering]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: He seems okay meetin' us.
</dd><dd><b>Biscuit</b>: See? They're grown-ups, and they get it. Bloofy should totally come to the fair with me, right?
</dd><dd><b>Spur</b>: Y'all don't really think that, do ya?
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Um... Hold on. Us grown-ups need to confer. [to Apple Bloom and Scootaloo] What do you girls think?
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: If they go to the fair, we can tag along!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: And Spur probably should share Bloofy. I mean, that's somethin' a grown-up would say, right?
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: As grown-up ponies, we think you should share Bloofy and let Biscuit take him to the fair.
</dd><dd><b>Biscuit</b>: That is some quality grown-up advice!
</dd><dd><b>Bloofy</b>: [chittering]
</dd><dd><b>Spur</b>: But Bloofy's never been around anything that exciting. What if something goes wrong?
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: We're headed to the fair, too. Since we're such great advice givers, feel free to ask us for more.

critter! You should enter him in the animal showcase. You'd be sure to
win "Most Interesting Creature"!

</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: You are supposed to be sharing him.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Yeah, I'm with Biscuit. The showcase looks like fun.
</dd><dd><b>Spur</b>: Sorry if I think taking care of Bloofy is more important than having fun!
</dd><dd><b>Bloofy</b>: [shrieking]
</dd><dd><b>Biscuit</b>: Bloofy's just excited. He probably just wants to get out.
</dd><dd><b>Bloofy</b>: [chitters, sniffs]
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Are you sure you're not just upset you have to share him? What if you took a little break?
</dd><dd><b>Spur</b>: You mean, like, leave?
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: If sharing him is too hard, that might be the best thing. Take our word for it. We are grown-ups.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: I don't know what Spur's so worried about. Bloofy and Biscuit are havin' fun.

</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I hope you're right about the girls coming here.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, once we read Shadetail
Evergreen's warning that the flower grants wishes, it wasn't a stretch
to think they wished themselves to the fair. It's all they were talking
about.
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Or maybe, since we told them they were too
young to come, they wished to become grown-ups, then came here and
caused some kind of trouble that led to a town-wide panic!
</dd><dd>[distant screaming]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah. Or that.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Twilight! Fluttershy! Thank goodness! I know you're not gonna believe it, but it's me, Apple Bloom!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: And I'm Scootaloo! We kinda got turned into grown-ups!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: And we thought we could take the train
here, since we were old enough, but we ended up in the wrong place, just
 like you said we would!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: And got lost!
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: Just like you said we would!
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: Then we met these foals who led us to the
fair, and we tried to give them some grown-up-style advice, but it
turned their pet into a tornado that might destroy the whole town!

</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: This one's excited.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: How do we calm him down?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: When they're young, a Mungtooth forms a
tight bond with its caretaker. They're the only ones who can get them to
 stop spinning.
</dd><dd><b>Biscuit</b>: Spur's the one who really took care of Bloofy. We have to find her!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You all go look for Spur. Fluttershy and I will do our best to keep everypony here safe.

</dd><dd><b>Biscuit</b>: I'm so sorry, Spur. You knew what was best for him all along.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: And even though we seem like grown-ups, you were way more responsible than us.
</dd><dd><b>Spur</b>: What do you mean, "seem" like grown-ups?
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Uh, we don't have time to explain. Right now we have to stop this, and you're the only one who can do it.
</dd><dd><b>Spur</b>: How?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I'll show you. He mostly just needs to see you.
</dd><dd><b>Spur</b>: Hey there, Bloofy-boo. It's okay.
</dd><dd>[whooshing stops]
</dd><dd><b>Bloofy</b>: [squeals, chitters]
</dd><dd><b>Spur</b>: How did you know what to do?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: After years of experience with animals, I've picked up a few things.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spur</b>: Well, one thing's for sure. Bloofy definitely earned the "Most Interesting Creature" prize.
</dd><dd><b>Biscuit</b>: I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: We all are.
</dd><dd><b>Spur</b>: I guess grown-ups aren't always perfect.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: They sure aren't, but young foals pretending to be grown-ups are even less so.
</dd><dd><b>Spur</b>: What do you mean?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: There's only one petal left. But I think the three of you know what to wish for. And I'm pretty sure Star Swirl won't mind.
</dd><dd><b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: We wish we were foals again.
</dd><dd>[magic sounds]
</dd><dd><b>Biscuit</b>: Hold on! You three are actually younger than us?!
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: The flower turned us into grown-ups, so we figured we could do whatever we wanted. But I guess that's not exactly true.
</dd><dd><b>Apple Bloom</b>: We did everything real grown-ups told us not to and caused all kinds of trouble.
</dd><dd><b>Scootaloo</b>: And things could have been a lot worse. I guess we were pretty selfish.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm glad you learned something. That's what growing up is. Which is why you probably shouldn't skip any of it.
</dd><dd><b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I know we didn't make the best impression, but we sure would like to visit you and Bloofy some day.
</dd><dd><b>Spur</b>: I guess that'd be okay, on one condition. You get a real grown-up to bring you.
</dd><dd><b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: Deal!
