</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Whoa! Ta-da!
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Okay, Spike. Now let's try a flip. Remember â€“ two flaps, then straight up!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Got it!

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You're doing great, Spike. Now let's see the big finish!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [sighs]
</dd><dd>[sloop!]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Whoa-oa-oa-oa!
</dd><dd>[crash]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [grunts] I don't know about "big", but I am definitely finished.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Maybe I should get Rainbow Dash. She's the one who taught me advanced flying techniques.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: No, thanks. If I'm gonna mess up, I'd rather do
it in front of you. I just don't understand why none of your advice is
helping.
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: Because she's teaching you to fly like a pony instead of a dragon.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: What's the difference?
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: Well, we don't have feathers, for starters.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: Ye-he-he-hes!
</dd><dd>[hoof-bump]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Wow! Thank you so much! How did you know I just needed to bend my wings?
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: Honestly, this is Dragon 101. Usually dragon parents teach this stuff.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[knock, knock]

</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike, I've been thinking about our flying lesson.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Uh-huh...
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I can't believe I overlooked something
 as simple as feathers. It's no wonder you were having trouble. I wish I
 had more "dragonish" knowledge to give you. Do you think being raised
by ponies has affected you in other ways? Spike?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Did you say something, Twilight? Sorry. I'm just
finishing up this "thank-you" throw pillow for Smolder. And you know how
 I get when I'm in the embroidery zone.

<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: It's a pillow! But not for your head. Although it
could be. It's a throw pillow. They're more casual. You can use 'em
anywhere. You don't like it.
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: Uh, it's not that. It's just dragons don't really use pillows. At all.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: What?
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: Hey, what's that?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I don't know. But it's... heading right for us!
</dd><dd>[crash!]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Okay. Now I really owe you for the lesson.
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: [groans, chuckles] Hey there, young dragons. [coughs] Name's Sludge. How are yours tails shakin'? [groans]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: You all right?
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: Yeah. What happened?
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: To what?
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: Oh. I don't need to explain myself to a couple of baby dragons. [groaning and whimpering]
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: Ow...
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Maybe not. But you're hurt and need help. So I'm taking you to Twilight's castle whether you like it or not?
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: Castle, eh? [groans]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm glad Spike brought you here, Sludge. I understand you made quite the impression in town.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Literally! There's a hole and everything!
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: Well, I hope you're not expecting me to fix it. [groans]
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: It doesn't look like you're in much shape to do anything.
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: I'll manage. Dragons take care of themselves. I don't need help from a bunch of castle-livin' ponies. [whimpers]
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: Darling, do be careful.
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: I'm... [groans] ...fine.
</dd><dd>[thud]
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: I can't watch!
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You're not the first stubborn dragon we've met, you know?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: And sometimes, even dragons need help.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I promise. My friends and I will only do enough to get you back on your claws.

<dl><dd><b>Sludge</b>: [chomp]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I know you had your reservations, but it's good to see you feeling better.
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: T-Thanks, I guess.
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: That's what friends are for, darling.
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: You're pretty lucky to have friends like these, kid.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Actually, I was orphaned as an egg, and Twilight raised me. So these ponies are more than my friends. They're my family.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We try our best, but sometimes I worry that maybe Spike is...
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Missing something deep down and dragonish.
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: Really? Wow. I-I can't tell you how glad I am to hear that.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Why in Equestria would you be glad to hear that?
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: I wasn't gonna say anything since your life
seemed so perfect, but I have a confession to make. Coming to Ponyville
wasn't an accident. I was looking for you. Spike... [sighs] I'm your
father.
</dd><dd><b>Mane Six</b>: [gasp]
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [continues gasping] Sorry.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: So you crashed in Ponyville on purpose?
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: Well, the crash part wasn't on purpose, but heading here was. I've been searching everywhere for you, kid.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Did you ask in the Crystal Empire? I'm kind of well-known there.
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Actually, Spike's well-known everywhere. Not a lot of dragons were hatched by the Princess of Friendship.
</dd><dd><b>Applejack</b>: Mm-hmm.
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: [choked up] You make it sound so simple. I wish you'd been there to help me search.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[doors open]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I can't believe it. I have so many questions.
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: Well, ask away. Answering questions is what dads are for.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I guess my biggest question is simple. Why was I an orphaned egg?
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: [stammers] You sure you don't want to ask
something else? [choked up] It's a lot of painful memories. [sighs] Your
 mother was the best dragon I'd ever met.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sludge</b>: [voiceover] The Dragon Lord even picked her to
scout for the Great Migration, and-and even though she just laid your
egg, we knew she'd have to go. But finding the Migration route could
take a lifetime, and you deserved a chance to know your mother. So I
went looking for you, carrying your egg to places no dragon or pony has
ever been. Past Mount Aris, the abandoned home of the Hippogriffs...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ooh! Did you visit Klugetown?
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: You've been to Klugetown?
</dd><dd><b>Mane Six</b>: [various affirming]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Also, the Hippogriffs returned to Mount Aris after we helped them defeat the Storm King.
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: Oh, well, have you heard of the Land of the... Scale Collectors?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Uh-uh.
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: [to Spike] Because that's where your mother's trail finally led.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sludge</b>: [voiceover] To a prison world of dragon hunters,
where I was forced to choose between surrendering myself or surrendering
 your egg.
</dd><dd>[clang!]
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: [voiceover, choked up] Of course, there was no
way I was gonna sacrifice my boy. So they took me instead, and that's
where I'd been ever since.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sludge</b>: Locked up somewhere not even the Princess of Friendship has heard of.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Whoa... How did you know I was a boy?
</dd><dd><b>Fluttershy</b>: Whatever happened to Spike's mom?
</dd><dd><b>Rainbow Dash</b>: And how did the egg make it all the way back to Equestria by itself?
</dd><dd><b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hmm?
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: I wish I had all the answers. [crying]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Well, that's all in the past. The only thing that matters now is that we're together. And I'm gonna make up for lost time.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: I hope you don't mind, but I have a list of all the things I always wanted to do with my dad?
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: Mind? Spike, my boy, with you by my side, I feel like we could do anything. What do you want to do first?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Well, I've kind of been working on a list for a long time.
</dd><dd>[scroll unrolls]
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: Dude, you want to do all of this?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh. I mean, w-we don't have to.
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: If you think doing everything on this incredibly
 long list is gonna fill the hole where your dragonishness should be,
then that is exactly what we're gonna do!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [gasps]

</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: Not really.
</dd><dd>[beat]
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: Uhhh, I mean, uh, I'm happy to do whatever you
want. But if I had a castle like this with all this stuff, I'd probably
just lay around all day doing nothing like a real dragon.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Like a real dragon?
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: Sure! I'm not surprised you don't know any better. Twilight basically raised you as a pony. You're barely a dragon at all.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Huh?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[doors open]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hey, Spike! How are things going with Sludge?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Honestly, I thought having him around would make me feel more dragonish. But I kind of feel less.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, I'm sorry. I wish I could help.
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: Awww, shucks. [chewing noisily] I guess I
shouldn't have said anything about you being more pony than dragon. I
just wish we had more in common.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Maybe you two can come up with ways to turn up Spike's, uh, dragonishness.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: You think that's something we can do?
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: You know what, son? I think it is!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Sludge</b>: Spike, I'm gonna teach you a thing or two about being a dragon. So, listen up, my boy, because I'm only gonna say this once.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Look at this castle where you live
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: It's pretty sweet, right?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>[Sludge]</b>
<dl><dd>You can't be a dragon here
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: Uh, I can't?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>[Sludge]</b>
<dl><dd>Look at these books up on the wall
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: Hey, I just finished organizing those!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>[Sludge]</b>
<dl><dd>This treasure pile's not right, I fear
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Trust me, I got you covered here. You see all this soft pony
stuff you're surrounded with? This has got to be the first thing to go.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Nothin' 'bout this place says "dragon den", there's too much fluff
</dd><dd>All these fancy robes, toss in a pile
</dd><dd>Take those goblets, dishes, is that gold? Still not enough!
</dd><dd>De-ponifying might just take a while
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Sure, this place is grandiose
</dd><dd>But to a dragon, it's just gross
</dd><dd>Time we make the lot all disappear
</dd><dd>Reality you need a dose
</dd><dd>To all these ponies, you're too close
</dd><dd>You just can't be a dragon here
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Good job, my boy! But this is still just the beginning!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Each and every dragon has a swagger all his own
</dd><dd>Watch and I'll show you what I mean
</dd><dd>You can't move like this with so much stuff to weigh you down
</dd><dd>A dragon always keeps it lean
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Lose this! This! Ooh, this is nice!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Your life is soft, your scales are coiffed
</dd><dd>These pillows, beds, and sheets are washed
</dd><dd>A delight, but it's just not right what's underneath
</dd><dd>Every dragon must be free
</dd><dd>Look at you, then look at me
</dd><dd>Since when do dragons brush their teeth?
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Ha! Please!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Sure, this place is grandiose
</dd><dd>But to a dragon, it's just gross

</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: What do I do?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>[Sludge]</b>
<dl><dd>Just grab it all and give to me
</dd><dd>After that, then you'll be free
</dd><dd>You just can't be a dragon heeeeere!
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Spike</b>: Ha! You're right! I feel better already!
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: See? What did I tell you? You're very lucky that I found you. Now, go get me some more.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: You got it! I'm gonna go get you all the cushy pony stuff I've got... Dad.
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: Great! Go get 'em... son!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>'Cause this dragon just can't wait to live here

</dd><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike? I just thought I'd check to see
 if you and Sludge had any luck turning up your dragonishness. It's hard
 not to feel like somehow I let you down all these years.
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: [grunting]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh! I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to barge in on ya!
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: [grunts, sighs] Ah, don't worry about it. <i>Mi</i> castle <i>es su</i> castle.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Right. Well, I'll just get out of your way.
</dd><dd>[door closes]
</dd><dd>[squeak!]
</dd><dd>[splattering]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh! Spike! I'm so sorry. My morning is not going well. What is all this? Why'd you leave the castle so early?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I didn't leave. I spent the night outdoors to get in touch with my dragon side.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Outdoors?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Yeah! And Sludge asked me to bring him the best
breakfast Ponyville has to offer so he can show me how a real dragon
would eat it. See you later!
</dd><dd>[door closes]
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[doors open]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: ...And that's why I thought we could use the map toâ€”
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Hey, gang! Dad was just showing me how a real dragon would act in a throne room.
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: Dragons like to sprawl when they get their claws done. [blows] Now, if you'll all excuse me, it's time for my bath.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [sighs] Isn't he the best?
</dd><dd><b>Rarity</b>: I'm not sure that's exactly the word I would use.
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: Uh, Spike? The bath isn't gonna fill itself, son.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Be right there... Dad.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm glad you're not spending the night outside again.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Oh, I am. I'm just looking for a good bedtime story to read to my dad first.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's nice that you have somepony to show you dragon culture. But are you sure that's what Sludge is doing?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: What do you mean?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, taking over your room, making a mess of things...
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [scoffs] That <i>is</i> dragon culture.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>You</i> never acted like that.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: That's because <i>you</i> raised me. Now I finally have a chance to see how I'm supposed to be.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I don't think you're supposed to be any different than who you are.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Maybe you just don't like that I have a <i>real</i> parent now.
</dd><dd>[cracking]
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That's not true! I'm glad Sludge is here. I-I just wish he wasn't such aâ€”
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Dragon? Of all ponies, I can't believe <i>you</i> would have a problem with that.

<dl><dd>[splashing]
</dd><dd>[bushes rustling]
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: What happened to you?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Just sleeping outside like we're meant to. It's not like dragons are supposed to live in castles.
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: I... guess not. But I live in the school. Nothing says we <i>have</i> to live outside.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [sighs] I'm so confused. It's been great having Sludge show me how to be a real dragon, but Twilight just doesn't get it.
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: What do you mean?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: She can't handle how good at being a dragon
Sludge is. Maybe someday, I'll be able to lay around doing nothing as
well as he does.
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: What?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Well, not now, of course. I'm too busy bringing him pony stuff so he can show me what a dragon would do with it.
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: So, Sludge just lays around while you wait on
him claw and tail? Uh, dragons are rude and rebellious, but they aren't
lazy lumps who take advantage of their kids.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Huh. Now I'm really confused.
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: Me, too. Why don't you tell me everything Sludge said about being a dragon?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: [chewing noisily] Hey! What's going on, son?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Twilight doesn't like having real dragons in the castle, so I told her we're moving out.
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: [coughs] You what?!
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: Spike! I found the perfect cave where you two can live! There aren't even any comfortable rocks inside!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: That does sound perfect!
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: No, it doesn't! I-I-I mean, uh, I'm not sure I fully demonstrated all the ways a dragon would live here.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: But we're not gonna live here anymore, so it doesn't matter.
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: It matters to me! [stammers] I want to make sure you have all the knowledge you need.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: But I do. Dad, you've already shared so much.
<dl><dd>[singing] This bed is much too soft
</dd><dd>Just take that silk robe off
</dd><dd>We can't be dragons living here

</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b> and <b>Spike</b>: [straining]
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: Stop! I'm not your father!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: What?
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: I just said that to get in on this sweet castle life.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: So... you... pretended to be my dad?
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: Now-now-now-now-now, don't look at me like that, kid. I did what any dragon would do.
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: No. You didn't.
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: Hey. I saw an opportunity, and I took it. <i>That's</i> what dragons do.
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: <i>No</i>. It <i>isn't</i>.
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: You know what? I don't need this. I'm out of here! Enjoy lovin' pony town!
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: [sighs]
</dd><dd><b>Sludge</b>: I'm taking this pillow.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I can't believe I thought somepony like that could show me how to be anything.
</dd><dd><b>Smolder</b>: Uh... it must be hard growing up not really knowing who you are.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: That's the thing. I know exactly who I am. And how I got that way.

<dl><dd>[door opens]
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Um, Twilight?
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh. Hi. Where's your father?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: He's gone. Turns out he wasn't what a real dragon should be after all. He also wasn't my real dad.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, Spike. I'm so sorry.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: <i>I'm</i> the one who's sorry. You were just worried about me, and I lost my temper. Sludge was just a great big phony.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I have to say, I'm not surprised.
There's no way a dragon like that was related to you. But if you still
want to search for your real family, I'd understand if you spent more
time in the Dragon Lands.
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: I don't think so. I already know who my real family is.
</dd><dd><b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Aww! It's me, right?
</dd><dd><b>Spike</b>: Mm-hmm! Besides, there's no way I'm living without pillows.
